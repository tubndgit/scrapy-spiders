Probably the worst apartment I've ever had in my life. Fire alarm will went off when turn on heater and people tell me it's normal. Fire alarm shouldn't went off for any cause other then real fire. Roaches everywhere. The rent is expansive for its low quality. If you look for higher living quality don't rent this place. I am sure there are better apartments out there.

Roaches everywhere when you move in; walls, drawers, shower, bedrooms, despite the staff's assurance that they ""personally haven't seen a single one"". The build quality of the rooms themselves (and everything they contain) is about as good as a five year old construction foreman's. The staff can be incredibly rude and act as if you're interrupting and won't do much for you unless you are persistent.

We wanted to move out after the first week and would break the lease if we didn't have to pay to do so. The managers and employees are extremely rude and unprofessional. Once your lease is signed, they start to ignore all of your emails and calls then pretend like you never tried to contact them at all if you confront them about it. After asking to move in a few days early and being denied, the apartment failed to even have our keys ready at 10am (open) on move in day. We were told by the employees that ""most people don't move in until 4."" In a rude and off put way which is a completely bogus excuse! Management is money hungry and doesn't care about residents. If you have a problem, even a serious one may take weeks to months to get fixed (management won't help). Costs keep rising despite nothing being improved and there is no explanation as to why the costs keep increasing. Don't be fooled if you see an ""owners comment"" on google reviews, this is just a farce to try to look good to unsuspecting customers, as if they were actually attempting to make up for the situation. In reality, the management doesn't care or even acknowledge that your problem exists. I have personally witness the manager scream at tenants who knock on her door to try to discuss problems with her. It is obvious that the manager does not care by her aggressive and rude attitude towards people! It is a low level employee who is typing these comments. The actual manager does not reach out and will do nothing to fix the situation. Our service animals have been discriminated by management as well and were forced to sit out in 115 degree heat on move-in day since we didn't have a cashiers check due to the managements failure to mention that a personal check wouldn't work or to even answer our phone calls when we took the initiative to try to find out. The manager made us fill out 4 forms to approve our service animals and my girlfriends Doctor informed us that the questions being asked on the form were illegal. They make disabled people jump through tons of obstacles and hassle them for a pet fee! Finally, management will kick you out of your apartment for a whole day 9am-5pm (plus three hours extra) to bug spray even if you don't request this service and you do not get to pick a convenient day either. The bug spray company they hire is a scam and doesn't work. If you look up reviews there are many bad 1 star reviews exposing this company for what it is. Also, don't be surprised if they steal from you. This apartment complex is infested by roaches and management is too cheap to even hire a legitimate exterminator to fix their problem. Instead they pay for the cheapest poorest service to at least look like they are trying. I would not recommend this complex to anybody! Save yourself the time and money and find a complex that actually cares about their tenants!",4 months ago

I wish there were more ways to get to know other residents and get together. I wish there was more of a community feel because I feel like most residents keep to themselves the most.  Maintence really cares about the residents and accomplishes tasks within reasonable times and measures with what they have available to them. When my AC went out during the summer, they weren't able to fix it the same day;however, they offered another place to stay due to the amount of heat. Always love saying hello to the staff & maintence. The complex always looks beautiful. One concern I would have would be the noise coming from our upstairs neighbors is consistently a problem and can be very distracting as a student. Although, me and my roomate usually make jokes about it. As well as, there have been multiple occasions where people are on the phone outside of our windows at night when we are trying to sleep. As for the ""bug issue"" that many residents talk about I think it is normal. I notice when the dishes pile or the trash has been full and in the house is dirtier than usual there are more bugs. However, when it's relatively clean there are not many issues with bugs. Especially living by one of the pools, you would expect more roaches. However, I do not have any major issues if you just keep your house clean. Other than these minor issues, I love living here!",2 months ago

Exterminators came to my apartment at least 6 times, but there was never any sign of improvement. I will admit that I am not the cleanest person at all times, but even when the apartment was spotless the problem persisted. The only time the roach problem got any better was when the exterminators treated my neighbors apartment, who had apparently been the source of the issue. However that was a short term solution as the bugs are now back and bigger than ever. When I first moved in the infestation was limited to the kitchen and bathroom, but now it has spread to the living room and even to my bedroom. My whole building needs to be treated, but management is too incompetent to realize that. If you want proof of how bad the bug problem is, look at the binder in the office titled ""Burns"", this is the name of the exterminator they use. The folder is at least twice as big as any other folder they have in the office. The fact that Burn's is scheduled to be here regularly 2-3 times per week further proves how much of an issue roaches are to the complex. I will admit that it's not the entire complex that is infested, just certain buildidngs, but there are still a number of issues with the complex other than the roaches. The AC in my apartment has broken at least a dozen times and everytime they ""fixed"" it breaks again, which is always great during the hot summer. The water has been out in the complex four times that I know of and management does a poor job of alerting residents to these outages. They seem to focus only on temporary solutions to problems rather than trying to actually fix the problems, so get used to reoccurring issues throughout your lease. Parking was a big plus for the complex when I moved here because it was free, but recently they started charging $20/month for covered parking, which leaves almost no room for a car unless you actually pay for parking. It also seems like nobody in the complex knows how to drive as I have almost backed into at least 5 times. Management is very inexperienced and they seem to lack the drive to improve, making them stagnant in reacting to any issues within the complex. Being so close to ASU gives them an advantage in terms of location, but management isn't business savvy enough to take advantage of it. For example rather that screwing over their residents by effectively forcing them to pay for a parking spot when there is plenty of room to park, they could just charge the students who park here a semester rate over the school year. Customer service is the last thing in their mind and I can't imagine their resident retention is very good, I knew three months into my lease that I would not renew. The actual layout of the apartments aren't bad and they are relatively spacious and they were fairly priced (at least in terms of cost/square foot), but it is not worth it once you consider all of the issues that have occurred. If you luck out and get a well kept apartment with no roaches, then it could potentially be a decent place to live. They don't advertise as being luxury apartments, so I wasn't expecting anything special but I was shocked with how poorly the apartments were kept and the overall unprofessionalism of the staff working here. I wouldn't recommend living here to anyone, it isn't worth the money at all.",8 months ago

My roommate and I are extremely clean and tidy individuals and the day we moved into our unit that was supposedly ready a few days early, was absolutely filthy. The kitchen and bathrooms were littered with body/pubic hair from the last residents, there was rotting food under the fridge, and to top it off THERE ARE ROACHES EVERYWHERE. The incompetent representatives, with the exclusion of one, all say different things when you call them asking for assistance or pest control. Week 2 living here our sink in the kitchen lost all work pressure and is down to a trickle so upon calling the office on a  Friday they told me that were is no maintenance on weekends so Id have to submit a request online and wait till maybe Tuesday so therefore having no kitchen sink to  do dishes or cook for 4 days. As for the roaches we were offered a different room that was across the complex and a sub-level but offered no assistance with furniture moving and I am partially disabled so it really wasn't a viable option. The one competent girl in the office set up a pest control appointment but failed to mention that they were coming in the evening so in reality we couldn't sleep there that night. Also that we would have to empty out our kitchen and bathrooms completely once a week for 3 weeks so they could spray which is only a temporary solution. We called an outside exterminator solely for advice to find out that spraying is only a temporary fix and that bombing is the only way to truly get rid of the  problem but it is more pricey. So all in all 12fifty5 is cheap, overpriced and doesn't give a dam about it residents but if want a curry smelling filthy overpriced apartment then this is the complex for you!",2 years ago

My roommates have had similar problems, and the guy next to me has a huge hole in his wall resulting from leakages that was never dealt with. Also, the walls here are very thin, and a lot of the appliances given to us have issues. What attracted me to this place was the reasonable cost and the fact that it was new. But when you live here for less then a month, you realize that the contractors took a lot of short cuts in order to build it as fast as they did. Furthermore, the elevators are always broken and they never fix it in a timely manner. All in all, i would not recommend staying here, and WOULD STRONGLY RECOMMEND that you find somewhere else to live, for there are far too many problems that me, my roommates, and multiple of friends that live in this complex have dealt with.

This place was terribly built and maintenance is just as bad. On the inside it is already falling apart (paint is chipping off nearly all apartment doors, hallway walls are scuffed and bashed in, and the stairs are disgusting). There are only two elevators for the whole six story building and one is closed for a week every time it rains, because water drains from the first floor into the elevator shaft and fries the elevator. Their website says ""Picture Life at Pearl"". Well picture this: walking 8 flights of stairs from your car two floors underground to floor 6 everyday because there's no working elevator on your side of the building. Now that's what I call ""Epic Student Living"". Besides this the ""Elaborate Clubhouse"" is a joke. It's a pool table and two TVs that can't be adjusted along with six randomly placed chairs that are mostly facing the wall. While the room may look pleasant, it's basically useless, especially considering it is locked up at 5 PM daily.",a year ago

This place is ran by nineteen year olds that are not allowed to make decisions. They have blatantly failed time after time. When a problem arises good luck getting in touch with someone. There is a parent company that obviously could give a crap about what goes on unless the money isn't rolling in. Paper thin walls and nothing works is the norm. When a problem does arise the logic that is thrown at the solution or lack of it gives me panic towards the future of our country and also has me wondering what UT will crank out as the people running the show are students. I would look at alternatives before trying this place. I am just waiting for what comes my way when she moves out. I am sure they will accuse her of cracking the foundation and try and charge me 500K. When she leaves I will update this review.,a year ago

Greystar handles the charges and says I can't send pictures to prove that the room was clean. How else are you supposed to prove that you cleaned? The supervisor Alex Fry at Greystar kept hanging up on me and wouldn't give his boss's name and email. Shows what type of children they employ at Greystar. My apt and another apt somehow didn't have pictures taken by the complex staff. They have a lazy procedure for checking out. They should walk the apt with you when you move out instead of checking the room after you move out. The complex staff can report anything but not have to show proof. Will never stay in a Greystar owned property again. If i could give 0 stars i would. Will be reporting this complex and parent company to consumer affairs.* Not worth the money. Won't be renewing my lease. Fridge, oven, and microwave were filthy when I moved in. I needed to move in early and was not given the option to have my room cleaned so i had to take it as-is which I was told ""there won't be any damages. We just wont clean the room"". Paint on walls and crown molding was damaged, no shower rod, and 3 light bulbs were out when I moved in. Bathroom was dirty and half an inch of dust on the ceiling fan. Took over a week to get the shower rod and light bulbs, and took a few weeks for them to agree to paint my room.

Sure the price is not the lowest in the area, but places like social tallahassee and villa lago that offer rent for cheap are really nasty and there are fights and other crap that people get arrested for.

It looks nice, but it's built horribly. Both my roommate and I's shower racks on the wall and door of the bathroom broke during the first semester. The desks, chairs, and tables weren't leveled correctly and the chairs would fall over if you bumped into them. Our dishwasher broke TWICE, the internet went out in our room a couple times, and the dryer was out for a day. When my boyfriend would stay over (which was most of the time) we would have to take like 3 minute showers each or the water would be freezing and the fan in the bathroom can't be turned off. It was so loud and obnoxious that I started using the shower and the restroom with the door open to my bedroom with that light on and the actual bathroom light off. I got charged a pet fine even though I paid the pet fee at the beginning of the year and we also got fined for trash being outside the door on the trash collection days. If I needed to pick up a package, but couldn't make it to the front office that day it was a hassle to have anyone else try and get it for me even if I called and said someone else was coming to get it. They lock the office after hours so if you want to print something you can't and to print something you need to spend like 10 minutes to figure out how to do so. Some of the staff was rude at times and made me feel uncomfortable. I could hear the people above me every time they moved in their bed, every time they walked, AND could CLEARLY make out some of the conversations they were having. The key fob they gave us was really bulky and I couldn't find a constant place to keep it. Not like I really needed it because the gates that were for our ""safety"" were broken for 6 out of the 8 months I lived there, so they were always open. THEN when they swore they fixed it, the sensor broke and no one could get out of the complex! Ridiculous. Also a really bad bug problem that was never fully resolved, which made me sick to my stomach. I thought it might just be my apartment but I've heard others complain about the same problem...gross. The walls and floors were so thin. All this and the rent was a ridiculous price of $735 NOT including electric which was about $70 a month and it's not even close to FSU. I would have rather lived in University Trails which is right across the street like I did the year before. All though it does not look as nice it was built much sturdier and you were given an insane amount of room for a much cheaper price! Not to mention I felt claustrophobic in my own apartment. For the price and all the cons you would think there would be a little bit of room in there, but NOPE. I lived with only one other person and can't imagine what it would have been like with 2 more people and the same amount of space. NO living space, NO kitchen space, and the bedroom itself could not even fit a dresser in it, we were provided with four drawers under the bed like you have when you're in elementary school which also couldn't fit much. I made it work, but it felt like I was trying to fit things in like I would a dorm when it's supposed to be a ""luxury"" apartment. If you're willing to pay this much then find somewhere closer to the school or just go across the street.",8 months ago

She was always available for my many questions and if I had to leave a message, she always returned the call. The grounds are kept well to include; the pool, dog park, volleyball area, and car wash.

I have lived in multiple places in Tallahassee, and this has by far been the worst. If you're looking for a luxury apt complex where you can relax at this is NOT the one for you. My boyfriend lived there for 6 months and I lived there for 2 months and for about 90% of the time the gates that surround the community and are supposed to make it safe were left wide open so that anyone and everyone can walk in and do whatever they wanted to. The management team is by far the least intelligent group I have ever come across, and have made countless mistakes about things. For starters they charged my boyfriend the wrong amount for rent (overcharged him) and then went back multiple times and had to fix it. And then when he moved out they tried to tell him that he never paid for certain pet deposits which he did. Then they tried telling him that for multiple months he was hundreds of dollars short on rent when in reality he was just paying different amounts on different credit cards. They lost some of my friends rent checks in their little mailbox they have to collect rent money and do not offer recipes when you pay by check so if they lose it your just out of the money. They double charged me for a pet deposit and when I went in I was told that it happened to multiple people. The apartments were poorly put together and rushed. In the apartment I lived in for 2 months there was a huge dip in the ""wood"" flooring about the size of a bowling ball. There is no way on earth that either of us could have made that dent and it was clearly from construction being that they laid the flooring out to fit perfectly into the hole. It was reported to the front office by 2 people on 2 different occassions and they said it was not a big deal and to not worry about it, but now they are trying to charge the both of us for it saying that they ""had no record of it"" and that their construction worker Kevin was very thorough. There are pool parties hosted by the management every single weekend which made it impossible to study in their study rooms and even in my apartment. If you even want to lay out at the pool on the weekends good luck. The multiple times I tried to I could not find seating and then during the week when I would want to lay out I would step on glass and get it stuck on my foot. BOTTOM LINE: the management there has no clue how to run an apartment complex and should not being running an apartment complex. It is extremely expensive for the amount of stress and head aches they have caused me. If you can find another place to live I HIGHLY suggest you do so.",a year ago

The walls are paper thin.. I can literally here people inside their apartments across the hall and above/below me. I also wish that they didn't lock up some of the amenities when office hours are closed (like pool, games, lounge area). Printing is a hassle, its impossible to just pull something up and print. You cannot turn off the fans in the bathroom unless you turn the light off too and that is probably one of things I dislike most. Also I hate that if we are not able to get to the office during its open hours then we cannot get our packages once they have left. Theres dog poop everywhere and no one does a thing to enforce picking it up. Gates are always open and security doesnt really do much. You are going to find things wrong at any place you live and there are also so many positives to this place too... the pool is awesome and they throw some fun events.

Everything is very modern and new. I love the fact that my visitors do not need to worry about visitor parking. All the amenities are nice, but I personally rarely use them. The staff half the time does not know the answer to my questions, and certain staff members can be rude about my multiple questions. The pool area is always flooded with people that aren't residents which can be annoying when one wants to relax on weekends. The hallways, staircases, and elevators are all very dirty due to the piles of trash people leave outside their doors, and from when valet trash employees dragged the trash bags on the floor at the beginning of the Forums opening. The maintenance staff are nice and get requests done with decent timing. Overall, the Forum is an okay place to live, but for the price can definitely improve.",2 years ago

I'm just a white guy with no ups who wants to shoot a few jumpers, but that's usually impossible. Pool is disgusting, water looks murky, definitely don't drink it. And for me the worst part is the wifi. As college students in the 21st century wifi is important for everything. Sometimes it's impossible to even do your online homework.

Move in day - the apartments weren't finished and you can definitely tell this apartments were rushed and very cheaply put together (the walls are thin so you can hear EVERYTHING, our floors were dirty/dusty, my shower head looks like it wasn't even put in properly, missing shelving units in cabinets, and the hot/cold water to my bathroom sink had been switched so the hot water is really the cold and vice versa.) Painting job was rushed. I have friends who help to build houses/apts/etc and they came over and just laughed at how these apts were put together. Didn't have cable/internet for a couple of weeks and after numerous times of having them ""write my apartment down"" I finally just went up to one of the century link people i saw driving around and he said our apt number wasn't on his list but now that he knew he would get to us within the next few days which he did. I was promised a $250 gift card by the leasing manager at the time which i never got and no one knew about it. (The new leasing managers are great so I will give them that). One of more of the gates to this gated community has been broken 80% of this year so any and everybody can just drive/walk on in. I also kept asking when the dog park and dog wash station would be done. A couple of the staff didnt even know they had such amenity while others kept saying within the week, every time i asked.  At the beginning, I was getting mail and packages late (I have tracking and text alerts so I know when my stuff has arrived - this issue did resolve though). I was late on paying rent one month due to some bank issues and a roommate of mine was also late so of course they charge the late fees and whatnot. Neither of us knew the other was late and that's how it should be. That's our own business. My roommate decided to go talk to the office to see if he could get the late fee waived and the leasing agent he spoke to told him that he could if he convinced his roommate, me, to pay my rent. You don't tell someone that information. I own a Rottweiler, and i kept getting different responses regarding whether or not they allow them, so i emailed greystar (the company that owns them) directly and they told me it'd be totally fine to have her and they didn't see why i was getting mixed responses so they put me through to the manager to set it up. And then I move in and everyone has pitbulls, huskys, and boxers -_- Now approaching the end of the year I happened across someone who knew me cause i'm seen walking my rottie and was asked how did i get them to allow her and i told him and the response was that they told said person that I would have to get rid of her. nobody mentioned any of that to me and I WISH SOMEONE IN THE OFFICE WOULD TELL ME I HAVE TO GET RID OF MY DOG. What threw me over the edge was last night (7/17/15). I left that morning as usual for work, locking my door behind me as always, i come home that night and my key no longer works. thought it was just my key so spent 10 min trying to keep using it, then i searched for the after hours emergency maintenance number and blew up that line until after another 25 minutes someone in maintenance called back and told me the locks were changed and that someone was suppose to have informed me. He went and got my new key. 2 weeks prior to the end date and they change locks and don't inform me??? are you serious... Moving out charges are ridiculous and they want us out by 10AM on the 31st. All in all I do not recommend this place. It is WAY overpriced. There are places with just as nice amenities for half the price . I'm so glad I did not renew and these last 2 weeks can't go by fast enough. I will give 4 stars to the leasing team including the new management and 5 stars to the maintenance staff especially the after hours team. Most of them are friendly and try to do their best to help, but living here is a def no. You can live somewhere else and probably still be able to use the amenities here for free.

I moved in and for a while it seemed pretty nice. But it won't take you very long to realize how misleading and low end things are. This building is just built so I will take some things into consideration. For starter, I rented a room in one of the two bedroom rooms and was promised some amount of square footage. Well, I only had one roommate and they didn't have any more people to put in the room so they are making us share a room and have LOCKED us out of the other half of the apartment. We are paying for a certain amount of square footage and yet here we are with a little more than half. Next, the rooms come with internet and cable. While it is convenient to not have to set it up yourself, the channels just cut out and you lose them for weeks at a time. I can't get ESPN and some other channels currently. When we moved in we were told that we received the wrong refrigerator and we needed a new one. Little did we know that that was one of two appliances that worked (the other being the microwave). The oven, washer, dryer, and dishwasher all did not work. Fast forward to the future when they have fixed these problems, now they have given us a new refrigerator. They only difference with this new refrigerator is that they have taken away our ice machine. Why? They advertise having a great game room and exercise facility. None of that is set up. There are wires hanging out of the walls where there are supposed to be tvs in the game room, the exercise room is weight racks but no weights, and pretty much everything else isn't set up. Finally, they are advertising this pictures on their website and as I am posting this on this website, that are extremely misleading. They aren't real photos as you may be able to see. In particular, the photo on the google page for MPE shows a big open grassy space across from the building while there is no such space. The buildings are right across from a parking lot for a call center.",2 years ago

I cannot agree more with the other negative comments on Rio West. Their leasing officers are terrible, with inpatient attitude and threatening words. Their rent is going up and up and up very fast, but none of my friends could even see a little improvement of their service and living environment. Their parking lot is horrible. They cannot even remove a wrong vehicle from my personal parking space in two days! What they can do is just ask residents to pay and pay and pay. When you leave Rio West, the leasing office will require a lot of repairs for your apartments, but do remember, all these repairs are not free. The leasing office will be able to discover this and that you caused and charge you a lot of money. At the beginning, they will ask you for a > $1500 deposit, in order to remove some additional fees from your initial deposit at the moment of your leaving!",a year ago

They towed my car once because people don't park their cars in their places, and made me go to their sketch tow company across town to get it back. Their appliances are from the 18th century, so if you stay there, watch your bills. They also threaten to evict you if you're one day late on paying for water (which by the way is usually also 10 dollars avg., if you're a normal human being there). Their also surrounded by sorority houses and the walls are bare minimum thin, so if you like staying up forever, this maybe the spot for you. I would say the only plus there is cheaper rent than usual, but personally it's worth the extra bucks than staying there. If you're a student, basically, do NOT live here.",2 years ago

It had everything I needed like all-bills-included rent, fully furnished, close to UTA, etc.  My roommate situation is not the best so I do wish that for future residents there be a more thorough roommate survey, or better yet move in with people you already know and can trust. I can agree that it is pricey but nothing I can do about that but pay. However, because of the price I am paying, I'm sure it's not wrong of me to expect to be able to park in the garage that is made for residents. I, along with others, have spoken to management about the issue of not being able to find parking in either the garage or side of the building due to overcrowding. We have even requested that something be done about all the unused reserved spots that go empty every day. Instead, we were given visitor parking which took up some of the resident parking and as great as it is to be able to now have guests, it should not be necessary for residents to ""compete"" for a spot in their own complex. When the manager replied to my emails about the issue, he said that, ""Our garage only has .8 spots per resident which brings the total number of spaces to around 481 (we have almost 600 residents)."" If you have the residential space for 600 people, shouldn't there have been enough vehicle space made for said amount of people? I understand that not every resident drives but that shouldn't mean you minimize parking space because of it. Tonight my boyfriend, who is also a resident, had to park down the block by Campus Edge and walk back to the complex because there was literally no spots available. The Arlie wants more people to renew and sign leases, but where is the space for them if they don't even have space for the residents they already have?",a week ago

Before I knew it, I'd been living here for three years. The first year was fine. Second year got a little worse. Third year was HORRID. Yes, rent was expensive, but I knew that when I signed the lease. I'm complaining about the TERRIBLE management. They treat us like kids when they want to, and adults when it's convenient for them. For example, they treat us like kids when they have random room inspections. I was stepping out of the shower when they bombarded my room. They didn't tell us exactly what time, they only posted generic signs in the building stating ""We will enter your rooms on June 2-9"". They'll treat you like an established adult, not a student, when it comes to rent. My scholarship was late being processed, so I fell behind on rent. Not because I couldn't afford it, but because my scholarship money was behind due to processing. The management wasn't willing to work with me. I received emails almost everyday about eviction, but they never responded to me when I explained my situation. When I went to the office to speak with them in person, only student workers were available, management was always out.  The security is inadequate. So much drug selling in this building. Many times the elevator and hallways will reek of marijuana. I've watched people who obviously weren't residents just ease into the building. It's security's job to make sure any non-resident is accompanied and signed in by a resident. I've had my boyfriend walk in and out with ease, and no, he's never lived in the building.  Weekends can get annoying when the elevators are full of empty cups and beer cans, and there's spilled liquor everywhere. I've seen drunk kids punch holes into the walls. For all the money I spent on rent to help keep the building up, I had to deal with a broken elevator for my entire third year living there. They NEVER fixed it. Inconvenient pool hours. Service requests went unanswered, I finally was able to get my dishwasher fixed after two months, but only because I saw the maintenance man in the elevator. He's really sweet, by the way. Probably the only good-for-something in this building. Save your time and your money and live somewhere else. It seems like a good idea at first (individual lease, conveniently near Target, groceries, and restaurants, gym, cable, pool, etc.) but it's not worth the headache. Sigh.

Another issue I had with living here was the ""utility fees."" In addition to the fortune you pay every month for rent and parking the view calculates a ""fee"" based on the percentage used by the whole building and divides it for each person. The confusing part is that in the months that most students are away such as June, July and winter break, the utility bills seem to double.

They say that they put in a $25 stipend for each roommate, and then the rest is divided among the four evenly. Yet, each month my utilities were about $50 extra, meaning that they were saying our (tiny) apartment was using $300 worth of utilities. We were VERY conscious of turning off lights, etc. so this was absolutely ridiculous. Beyond that, the people working at the View are useless and not at all helpful or friendly.

My biggest problem with this place is that it way over priced for the quality of each apartment.  Obviously when they were building this place they decided to build it cheap because it was mainly going to be student housing.  This place really needs to lower its rates to get its occupancy up, but the people who run this place are not the brightest.  This leads me to my 2nd problem which is the management.  The people running this place are not gracious by any means, the security here are being paid to just to sit at a desk and basically ignore your every concern, and for some reason, we have had maintenance people go into our place randomly when we are not in the apartment and write us up for ridiculous reasons (like having a vacant room's door open and claiming we are using the room when there is nothing in there and we have never even walked in there.)

Yes it's a college apartment so there will be loud people or random stuff in the halls, but it's less expensive than most of the other apartments that are the same distance from campus and they have lofts if you want to pay less. I live with two other dudes and my room and living space still feel big enough. It has a nice balcony, and the pool/grill area works for bigger groups. The appliances are great and almost never break, and if anything does break I can file a maintenance request and have it fixed within the day (seriously they are SO good about maintenance and thats the thing I hear other people complaining about the most in other places).

Here's a list of things I have seen around the complex: dog poop and vomit in the halls, a shopping cart left by the pool, old pizza slices abandoned in the elevator, bags of trash left in the hallways, etc. The walls are like tissue paper. My unit was infested with ants. All the AC vents in our unit were filthy and the floors hadn't been cleaned when we moved in. The paint job was crap and the painters had gotten paint all over our floors. It always smells like marijuana and dog poop. The delivery guys leave packages outside the doors in the hallways so that anyone can steal them. The cable doesn't work, the internet is unbearably slow, and our power frequently goes out.

The management, however, seems slow to respond to questions (by email at least), and has on at least one occasion provided information on Facebook about three days before the same information was released via email, where it would have been much more useful.  I have heard that the management is changing, which does give them some leeway, but it does need improvement.  Maintenance issues are dealt with swiftly, however, which gives them some points.  The rent is also pretty high and, apparently, getting higher.",a year ago

The people who work at West Village are extremely nice and friendly and make you feel glad that you are living there. There are many community events, such as the Harvest Festival and Casino Night that allowed me to get to know the other people who are living in the community. With the newly-finished swimming pool and hot tub just a short walk away from my apartment, I feel like I am living in a resort rather than an apartment complex! The rooms come fully furnished with a huge bed and your own bathroom and walk-in closet and the amenities are brand-new so everything is beautiful. Another great perk of living here is the proximity to campus. It is literally a 10 minute bike ride to the ARC, and if you do not want to bike to school the V line bus comes every 15 minutes.

My mother and I went on tours for multiple different properties throughout Davis and nothing really caught my eye. Right as we were about to give up, we was randomly told about a place called West Village. I had never heard of this complex before and it didn't pop up on any of my search results but we decided to take a chance and visit it. When we crossed over the freeway, it was like a little oasis of an apartment complex popped up out of nowhere. When we walked into the main leasing office we were greeted with smiling faces and an awesome high-tech coffee machine. Kate, one of the leasing professionals, gave us a wonderful tour of the model apartment and our jaws dropped to the floor. This place took our breath away. It blew away every other complex that we had seen out of the competition. From the eco-friendly designs to the giant swimming pool, West Village had us sold the minute we saw it.

My answer is West Village for multiple reasons, many of which may not appeal to everyone, but the little minute details matter to me. One of the first things you will notice here is the number and scale of events that are held throughout the year, ranging from taco tuesdays and movie nights in the huge theatre room to the extravagant Casino Night, where everyone dresses up to win thousands of dollars worth of prizes playing popular casino games with real dealers while being fed amazing catered food- no other complex can compare. You can find students all over campus wearing the West Village brand because of all the attractive promotional items that are handed out to residents and nonresidents at sport events for absolutely free; some of the newest and most unique items introduced were texting gloves, scarves, coffee thermos and mugs, and bottle openers (items that could be purchase on campus with marked up prices). The majority of staff that residents interact with are actually student residents as well, providing a customer service dynamic that is more interactive and comforting for residents; in my experience, they have all been very respectful, efficient, and sociable individuals, along with the superb management currently overseeing the property.
