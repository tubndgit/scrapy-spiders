The Boulevard Apartments,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-boulevard-apartments-houston?search_key=58224,5.0,The Boulevard is a great quite place in an area surrounded by business. The staff is quick to respond to requests for service. The staff is very professional and ready to help. I have great respect for the office and maintenance staff. Look forward to being here for a long time.,2017-01-02,Armando G.
The Boulevard Apartments,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-boulevard-apartments-houston?search_key=58224,3.0,"These apartments are old and outdated and therefore probably a little overpriced. But they were also clean, cozy, and in a great location. 

The staff member we spoke with was very friendly and knowledgeable. This place isn't going to try to wow you with a huge ""community room"" and a 24-hour Starbucks machine, but that might be a good thing. 

This seems like a nice place to live if you're not bothered by outdated cabinetry, appliances, etc. That makes me sound snobby, but just being honest.",2016-07-05,Melanie H.
The Boulevard Apartments,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-boulevard-apartments-houston?search_key=58224,5.0,"We just moved out of the Boulevard Apartments. We lived there six months before finding a home to lease near the school we wanted our daughter to attend, otherwise we would still be there! The management team (Jennifer and Anthony) are wonderful. Friendly and very responsive. Luis, who is in charge of maintenance, is the best. These were truly the best maintained apartments I have ever lived in, I believe in great part because of the excellent job he does (along with management's dedication to running a great complex). Luis is always cheerful, takes such pride in his work, and makes sure things are done correctly any time you put in a work order. 
We experienced NO crime while we lived there, I felt very safe. They make sure the gates are always working. Other places I've lived, gates could be broken for a week at a time and no one cared, not here!
I really can't say enough good things about this place. There is a reason there is a wait list. Get on it.",2015-11-02,Raina W.
The Boulevard Apartments,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-boulevard-apartments-houston?search_key=58224,5.0,"This is a very safe, nice-looking, well-maintained, no-frills apartment complex in a great location in Rice Village.  I mean no-frills because compared to other apartments, the front office is smaller, there is a tiny fitness center and an average swimming pool/bbq area.  However, personally, these things don't matter much to me since the top things I look for is location, appearance, apartment build/quality, safety, and value, and this place delivers it 200%.  

Another huge positive is the management who is very attentive to the tenant's needs, and every request has been handled professionally and immediately.  For example, our older washing machine started leaking so we called the front office and either the very next day or 2 days later, it was removed and replaced with a brand new one.  Also I can't say enough about Luis, the service-man.  He is very professional, courteous, and he always completes everything on time and with a smile.  

The best thing about these apartments is that it is relatively inexpensive in cost compared to other apartments of the same high quality around Rice Village.  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for an apartment in the Rice Village/Medical Center/Midtown area.",2014-09-10,Earl I.

The Boulevard Apartments,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-boulevard-apartments-houston?search_key=58224,5.0,"We have lived at the Boulevard for over two years and are very sad to leave. However,  we are having a baby and we feel it is time to be grown ups and actually invest in a house. We lived in the area at another apartment complex for a few years before moving here, but they kept raising our rent in large increments and so we decided it was time to move. After driving around we stumbled upon this complex and are we glad we did. We ended up being on a waiting list to move in because there was a high demand for the 2/1 because the price compared to all other places in the area is not even close (at least at that time). We were very fortunate that we were able to get in when we did! We rented the apartment without even seeing what the 2/1 looked liked inside. We were able to see a 1/1 to get the idea of what we could expect. Truthfully when we actually got to see ""our"" apartment I was a little disappointed. I felt like it felt older than I remember the 1/1 looking. The stove seemed old, the kitchen cabinets seemed dated (which they kind of are) and the washing machine had a weird stain around the seal. HOWEVER, after talking to the manager Jennifer and getting maintenance out there, they changed out the washer quickly because he was not able to get the ""stain"" out. Now, the stove and kitchen cabinets are indeed kinda dated, but work well. The kitchen is a nice size and I always seemed to have plenty of cabinet space. The bathroom in the 2/1 is HUGE and I LOVE it! 
The pool is never crowded and although the fitness center is incredibly small it still has enough equipment to keep you active. The maintenance man (I am 98% sure his name is Luis- pregnancy brain is in full effect right now so there is a 2%+ change I am wrong on that) is SUPER nice and has been there for years. He is very efficient and always has a smile on his face. When I am walking around outside or getting the mail and I see him he always says hello. I sure wish I could take him to fix anything in my house that goes wrong :-). 

Like I said above, we are very sad to leave this complex, we have always felt safe here which was very important to me and I am sure to many people! 
Because it is on a neighborhood street, it feels like you are living in a neighborhood and not just a large apartment complex, which is a nice feeling. You are close to everything, one mile from Rice Village, easy access to 59 and upper Kirby. We have had very few issues with parking, sometimes on the weekend or certain times during the summer it might get a little congested, but I have never had to park very far from my apartment at all. 

I just cannot express how great it has been living here, we will miss it very much! I do hope whoever moves in after we leave will share the same feelings and treat this complex like the gem it is!",2014-10-20,Chelsea W.

GREAT LOCATION, GREAT NEIGHBORS, VERY SAFE!!! My AC broke the other day and they fixed it right away. Maintenance has been very responsive. Jennifer and Anthony have been very great to me as well.

The Boulevard Apartments,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-boulevard-apartments-houston?search_key=58224,5.0,"I lived here during my year off-campus while at Rice University, and chose to move back here after graduating because it was such a great place.  It is safe, quiet, nice, well-maintained, and affordable - can't ask for more!  A number of my friends at school lived here too and all had a positive experience.

Best things about this apartment complex:
+Close to Rice University and med center
-Walking distance to Rice Village and lots of other restaurants
+Low noise from neighbors - the only time I have heard any neighbors above or below me is when I had an upstairs neighbor that was jump-roping, and I don't fault the apartment for that!  This is very important to me and I am so glad it's quiet.
+Best value for the money - there are a couple places that were cheaper, but none nearly as nice as this place.  You are spending just a little more for a LOT nicer.
+Easy parking - We didn't pay for reserved spots and have never had a problem getting a spot.  If you come back very late at night, you might have to park farther away from your door, but it's such a small place that the ""far"" spots aren't really big deal.
+Reliable and quick maintenance
+Ability to pay rent and request maintenance online
+Pet-friendly - that was a ""must"" for me with 2 cats.
+Spacious, well-laid out floor plans

The only ""cons"" I can think of are so minor they are more neutral than negative, but I guess it would be that the fitness center is not much to write home about (just a couple machines and some weights, fine for basic needs but nothing special) and I wish they offered recycling services/pick-up.

I am moving out of state soon, and wish I could find a place exactly like the Boulevard when I move.",2013-08-07,Rebecca G.
The Boulevard Apartments,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-boulevard-apartments-houston?search_key=58224,4.0,"I found this place at the recommendation of a close friend who had lived there for about 3 years. I have a had a few negative experiences but in my mind, that goes with renting anywhere. Specific to this property, I would say my experience has been overall positive.  There are a lot of long term residents there that continue to renew...which I like, you see a lot of familiar faces. The price is reasonable for the area and I feel extremely safe which was my #1 concern. I would definitely recommend this place to others - it has been a great experience for me and the pro's definitely out-weigh the cons.",2013-07-11,Elissa M.

The U-Davis,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-u-apartments-davis,3.0,"UPDATE: 1 star rating to a 3.5 star rating

In my previous update I stated how badly things went with my heating system, move-in day was dreadful, bug/ rodent issues on the first floor, slightly slanted construction, and some errors with roommate preferences. 

Due to how horrible my previous rating was, I was contacted by a regional employee (Jasmine you're the sweetest!) who discussed all the issues I faced while living at the U. After a nice conversation, I had a small change of heart of how I felt about the U and here's why:
-I had some issues about resident referrals but they were all approved (this approval occurred before I received the referrals but it was a small battle I was facing and thought it wasn't going to get approved so I didn't mention it), the fact that an employee personally called me to apologize for the circumstances I faced plus we both had an adult conversation (trust me I've had people call me just to lecture me instead of actually resolving issues), and because I've been getting to know the leasing office employees more and they are helping me understand their standpoints of how difficult it can be to run an entire apartment complex.

-I still stand by the maintenance being a little off at times but they have gotten better. 
-Another thing i couldn't mention before was the garbage situation, every single weekend there is a huge line of trash near the trash compactor which I believe is due to the fact that you need to use a heavy pole to push the trash in since it makes holes in the trash bags and trash can't be pushed in further. I think a flat bottom would be an easy fix to the trash issue so that the second maintenance man doesn't have to deal with other people's mess.
-For amenities, the U was pretty helpful my first quarter with the free printing situation, however there is no color printing and sometimes computers (especially the Macs) will stop working
-I've been using the gym more often and noticed that all the equipment is nice, however the TV's for the treadmills don't have many channels but I just watch YouTube videos on my phone anyways. And also I have not heard about any accidents happening in there.
-Parking situation sucks sometimes (plus I've had people park in my parking spot EVEN THOUGH I paid for my parking spot every month) but there are guest parking spots now and you can park in ""Future resident"" or ""employee"" parking at certain hours of the evening/night. 
-Walls are thin at this apartment complex to where I can hear people talking/walking in the hallways if I'm sitting in the living room
-Big bonus when The U hosts events where you can win King's tickets and get free food but honestly I really think The U should focus more on other things like how residents actually feel about the complex and can give an anonymous suggestion/complaint. 
-Location wise, it's pretty far from campus. Tried walking to downtown and that took about 20 minutes then another 15 minutes from downtown to campus. Bus line is about a 7-10 minute walk depending on what cars let you cross the roundabout, sometimes they might run you over so look both ways! then the bus ride is about 20 minutes to campus. Driving is about 9 minutes to the MU and 14 minutes to Silo or the West Entry parking structure.
-Pet deposit is a little high and there is a $25 monthly fee but there are doggy bags outside to compensate kind of? 
-Mail is a little of a disaster because you'll get a BUNCH of mail from previous residents (I've gotten random Journey's packages or packages from Korean beauty shops) and it's a little bit of a pain having to bring it to the office for mail that really isn't mine but The U is really nice about having your packages handled depending on the carrier (sometimes packages will be outside your door so be careful of theft!)
- Again the bedding sizes are QUEEN not full, so don't even try to fit a tiny sheet on these huge beds.
-Laundry is included in the apartment but it can be a little too loud 

There's still more room for improvement at The U and I would highly suggest the U to implement a suggestion box or survey with some kind of raffle for all residents on how they can better their apartment complex. 

And again one star for Kyle (remembered my full name and apartment number), one for Jasmine (for taking time out of her day to talk about issues with me), and one and a half star for the beauty in this apartment (seriously everything is renovated so not that many dings in furniture just yet.)

I'd rent here again if the prices were rising and if it wasn't so far from campus.",2017-01-25,Faith C.
The U-Davis,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-u-apartments-davis,2.0,"Last year I lived at the U, and I say if you can afford it it's an ok place to live. I think a lot of their criticism comes of the management mostly.

The major upside to all this is the amenities. I signed onto a furnished apartment which included the major appliances (dishwasher, in-unit washer/dryer) and living room/bedroom furniture. The clubhouse has 24-hour access (printing room, gym, 2 study rooms) and during office hours they have a game room. It's worth paying if you actually utilize all the amenities. 

Another upside is the individual leases. You were only held liable for your portion so if for some reason a roommate couldn't make rent it's not your problem. Utilities were included, you just split PG&E between your roommates. I think they actually added a ""city fee"" for water so that is another additional cost. 

Now the many downsides. At the beginning when I moved in management really sucked. They matched one roommate who had a cat but another was allergic. We messaged management a couple weeks before move-in but they didn't offer to move the girl or any other alternatives. Total violation of their own lease agreement under the pet addendum if the pet was a health hazard.

Another problem when my roommates and I signed our leases during the summer we were told that construction would be done by the time we moved in. Construction/renovations lasted for the next 11 months of my 12 month lease, starting at 8am-5pm.

The location of the apartment is about 2 miles away from campus, its close to Target and a 24-hour Safeway which are both just a couple minutes drive. It is also next to 2nd St which the train runs along quite often. Sometimes you get used to it but other times the screeching of the wheels on the track really gets to you.

The bus stop is about a 3-5 minute walk and it's about 10-15 minutes by the A or Z line to the Silo/MU. It's not that bad of a ride but 
if a train passes by AmTrak the bus will get stuck and have to wait.

There is close to no guest parking, they only have guest parking spots during non-business hours, 5 spots in front of the clubhouse but if you park there during office hours they will tow you! Parking spots range from $20-40 a month and they are all assigned. No street parking, the closet you can get is at the Goodyear about 0.5 miles away. If someone happens to park in your spot you can tow them but the towing company that complex uses is located in Dixon. If they pick up the phone, it takes them a while to come to Davis, and the person who parked in your spot could of already left.

My apartment was facing the inside of the complex/pool which was nice at times. Though at night people might be having a small gathering, either at the gazebos, fire pit or volleyball court and it can get pretty loud. It's funny because sometimes people can think going to the pool is private (even at night), but just beware, the people with apartments facing inside can see everything, ya nastys, no wonder the jacuzzi turns green at least once a week.

Also something gross and unprofessional that happened during the summer, the last months of my lease, was an employee. I was walking down the stairs to the clubhouse I see a figure in sweeping in the hallway. The person called me to come over in the obvious cat-calling manner. I simply waved and said hi from the stairway but kept walking down and could hear him mumbling words under his breath. It was only later that I looked out my balcony to find out that this person was a new hire for the complex. Super unprofessional at their place of employment and I was really put off by that situation.

After moving, two of the girl that I currently live with were roommates that I had at the U and none of us happened to get our security deposit checks mailed to us after 3 months. We finally contacted them and turns out they didn't bother to put our apartment number in our forwarding address. The fact that they messed up the forwarding address on three separate occasions is beyond me. It took a week but we were finally able to get it sorted out and mailed to us correctly.

Lastly, I can't imagine what their resident retention rate is but their employee retention is horrible. Not one employee works there from when I moved in! From the associates, manager and accountant not one stayed. Though when I was moving out the new set of associates and manager seemed nice and adequate enough. 

If you were to take away anything from this long critique is that though the U is nice, it's just essentially a slightly cheaper version of West Village. They've raised rent so you're looking at low to mid $800s for a single room. Plus they're way further from campus then West Village so much as well shell out a couple hundred extra if you can afford it. Though it is nice that it is furnished making moving in and out a little easier, with all the downsides there are a lot of other apartments in Davis that you can find without these problems and at a way cheaper price.",2016-11-21,Victoria C.
The U-Davis,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-u-apartments-davis,1.0,"I wish I could give zero stars but I can't, ignore the only star there, they don't deserve it. 
The first day check in was horrible. I was stay in line at least 3 hours before I got my key. It was horribly slow. However all those things are acceptable because even they should try to arrange everything so that residents should not need to stand there for so long. 
However, one thing that I can't accept is that window in my room is very small, roughly half size of my Roomate""s and we pay the same money for rent. The view of window is blocked mostly left and right by walls, so the view I can see is very small and dark. But my Roomate""s room looks very bright, and this is not like only one time, it""s about 12 month. But when I talk to them about my situation, they are not even trying to do anything but saying that they can't do anything about it. But they didn't let me know how big the difference before I decide to move in. That""s a fraud! Seriously, don't regret before you moved in, because then you are not going to be treated before you signed the contract. 
Remember you had a choice, don't be regret!!",2016-09-18,Xinyue L.
The U-Davis,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-u-apartments-davis,1.0,"Save yourself a lot of stress and STAY AWAY. 

The overall look of this place is great, but it doesn't make up for everything that is wrong with it....
First and foremost, the new staff IS TERRIBLE. (Bring the old staff back!!) The new management doesn't care about you. They are inconsiderate and make soooooo many mistakes. AND if they make a mistake they'll say the same lame-a** excuse.. ""Whichever employee told you ____ didn't know what they were talking about."" 

GUEST PARKING IS NONEXISTENT. You'll never have anyone over and if you try, you'll probably get towed. Even if someone takes your spot and you have to park somewhere else. They will lie to you in the beginning and guarantee to you that there is. 2ND street is a 15-20 minute walk; it is not close. BTW, $35/month for parking on top of your expensive rent.

The cheapest single room is $850+; Just go live at the rambles and be super close to school.  

The study pods consist of literally 2 tables. 

The A and Z buses are not always that reliable. (Occasionally, it doesn't even come at the time said on Unitrans). This is supppper inconvenient when the buses come every 30 minutes.  

Construction started at 7AM during finals weeks. So imagine staying up till 5AM and trying to sleep. Even that its summer, they continue to start whenever they want. Again, management doesn't care about the residence. 

I know this isn't necessary, but there is no appreciation to residents like other apartments. DESPITE PAYING SO MUCH, there is never any ""Free scantrons + Donuts"" day anymore. The old staff used to do this, but after months with the new staff- nothing. 

PS. THEY MADE A MISTAKE ON MY BILLING and threatened to evict me, without even acknowledging that it was THEIR MISTAKE. 

Overall, yeah this place looks nice, but wow is everything else so sh*tty.

The U-Davis,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-u-apartments-davis,1.0,"Check my profile. I do not give 1 star reviews. I AM A GRACIOUS YELPER, Y'ALL. So if I am rating this place 1 star, you better bet this place sucks. I'm feeling vindictive right now so I'm gonna share it on my facebook too. Good luck getting people to lease.

I started out LOVING The U. The grounds are gorgeous, the rooms are spacious and the amenities (24/7 gym, free printing, pool/volleyball court/BBQ patio) outshine every other apartment complex I've ever seen.

Then I started noticing all the problems with the apartment:

- The bathtub grows mildew UNDER the caulking. Which means you can Mr. Clean and Clorox all you want, but unless you strip off part of the tub there's going to be unsightly black growth that makes your guests think you don't clean your bathroom. If I fail to receive my deposit back for this reason, I will update this review to reflect that.
- First the toilet handle broke. Twice. Then they finally fixed it and the toilet leaks. I've put in multiple service requests and it is changed to ""completed"" but the toilet. Still. Leaks.
- Construction ALWAYS. The year started with construction in the volleyball pits. They finished that and moved onto the pool. They finished that and moved onto the BBQ pits. Now they're tossing around stoves (??!? Legitimately saw stoves from my 4th floor window). All. Year. Including finals week. Including weekend mornings. I started to think of the sound of drills, clanging metal and the slamming of chain link fences as an association with ""home.""
- Due to ""construction"" they have turned off ALL water (sinks AND tub) for full days.

**This parking issue deserves its own section cus I'm an organized gal and it deserves emphasis.**
- My parking was changed 3 times due to construction. The first time they put our TANDEM parking spot into a single spot, which means that one car would have to go without parking. I came in to ask about it and the person in charge of parking said ""Oh, sorry. I'll fix that and send you an e-mail. This will only be for a week and a half and you'll have your old spot back!"" 

We were then assigned a parking spot that was 15 spots away from our original spot. They put a notice on our door that we had to move our cars by the end of the week or else we'd be towed. Okay, annoying, but still walkable. We'll deal with it. Then they left a notice on our door the next week telling us to move our car **40 SPOTS OVER** or else ""we will be forced to tow your vehicle at the owner's expense."" The new parking spot is a whole building over from our building; the old spot was right in front of our building. 

Things that aren't ""wrong"" but still unreasonable:
- Tandem parking is $40 ($20 each car). Most other apartments have free parking.
- 10 guest spots in an apartment complex that has FOUR 3+ story buildings. 10 spots. That's it. There are hundreds of people living here. Why is there no guest parking? Do y'all hate friendship? 

If ALL this happened and the management was the same as it used to be, I would give it a solid 3 star rating. Annoying stuff doesn't bother me enough to leave a 1-star review. Outlandishly bad service does.

The management used to be wonderful - even though there were still issues with the apartment, the old shift lead (I think? She always wore a skirt suit) was an incredible customer service representative. She never gave me special treatment - never decreased our rent, or gave extra amenities, or anything like that - but she was respectful, helpful and genuinely seemed to care.

**The new staff**
- The BIGGEST issue I had occurred yesterday (my birthday T_T) when I received a notice about a delinquent balance of $100 on my account that I needed to pay within 3 DAYS or I WOULD BE EVICTED. I was confused because I paid my rent on time as usual. I called in to ask and the staff member who answered told me that (this is verbatim) ""Oh, I added the charge to your account because there was a false credit on your account from last month. The false credit happened for some reason...idk why.""

Here is where I take the most issue: I called in today at 4:10 p.m. to ask about the delinquent charge. I asked why, despite the undercharging last month and me paying the LISTED rent on time, I was threatened with eviction if I didn't suddenly come up with a hundred bucks by tomorrow. He answered calmly, ""I understand that our office staff confirmed the lower rent for this month, but you have been paying $___ all year. We do need to receive the rent as soon as possible to prevent more serious action."" That does not resolve my current issue - that we confirmed with the office last month that the lower rent was correct! Why am I being threatened with eviction when this was an office error? Why am I being given 3 DAYS to pay what is effectively 1/5 of my rent? I ended the phone call feeling frustrated, with no effort on the staff member's part to be helpful beyond ""I'll talk to the accountant.""

I'm so glad I'm leaving.",2016-07-13,Katherine V.
The U-Davis,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-u-apartments-davis,3.0,"First off, the 2 stars for the apartment being very well furnished and nice. They did a great job with the patio and the bbq pit area as well. 
This review is mainly for the front desk and also the renovation and construction going on. The construction goes on during the day time, and it's loud and annoying especially when you live right about it. Second off my housemates all pay about 45 dollars a month for tandem parking and have had their Parking spots changed 3 times within a couple weeks. We have no guest parking at the U. And for the price you pay for parking and to have them kinda just inconvenience you like that is unacceptable. Also because of the construction, water has been shut off without warning twice in the past month, and 2 more other times since I've moved in. It's a huge inconvenience because it's shut off for an entire day... I can't shower, cook, clean. I'm pretty lucky it hasn't ever shut off halfway through my shower, but I'm pretty sure it's happened to other people. They're lucky it's summer and mostly everyone's moved out. Which is probably why they don't want to mind inconveniencing those of us still here. I wonder why so few people have wanted to renew their lease.... The only helpful person from their staff is the maintenance guy. The front desk after changing employees is now very rude and unapproachable. (Except for one employee in the front (who's name I forgot to ask for)) but he was very nice and clear about parking.) there was no attitude given so he gets one star for being polite and helpful. 
In conclusion, the U is not worth the money you pay for it. The prices will be going up like it did last year.",2016-06-24,Katherine L.
The U-Davis,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-u-apartments-davis,1.0,"Horrible place. I lived in numerous places in davis in South and North Davis, but this place is by far the worst place I experienced the most stress from. Three managers changed within 8 months, and staff members last no longer than 3-4 months max. So called ""miscommunication"" takes place too often. I have horrible experiences to share, but I heard an international student who paid $1600 as deposit when he first moved in, but now the office is telling him that he only paid $150 as his deposit. That's how they are bad at keeping residents' records (if they are not lying).

They also say free high speed internet, but it's so slow that I had to get my own internet for another $70/month.

A very special thank you to Nia for always providing great customer service throughout my entire time here. I would definitely recommend it!,2016-07-25,Damon L.
The U-Davis,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-u-apartments-davis,1.0,"J.A of the U,

Thanks for your reply, it shows you value your customers feedback. The overall issue is that customer service is great before you sign the lease. Once you are locked in to the lease, your team doesn't seem to care. The office staff is typically unhelpful and don't seem interested in trying to help with issues. Customer service should be most important not only to potential residents, but to your current residents. 

As far as the construction goes, it's kind of a joke. The construction started after winter break, promising to be completed before spring quarter. Then it was pushed back to before summer, the latest information I now have is September. The construction has taken away, the workout room, the pool table, the computer room, guest parking, the pool areas, and parked a ugly giant trailer in front of the clubhouse. All of these amenities were promised to me, part of the reason I signed the lease, then without an alternative they were taken away indefinitely. 

Today your team had my car towed from the apartment complex where I live! That is absurd! I pay $800 a month to have my car towed?!!! I was parked in a 6pm-6am spot, because there are no guest parking spots available. Even if I wanted to purchase a spot, none are available. Effectively there is no parking for guests, which was promised to me and is featured on your website. This is advertising to new potential residents and it is a lie. 

I have already started and will continue to influence as many people as I can to not live at the U. People are upset, you will notice when the money stops coming in. Residents will pay extra for GREAT customer service, they will avoid HORRIBLE customer service.",2015-08-02,Matthew W.
The U-Davis,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-u-apartments-davis,1.0,I never received the $800 dollar deposit after 7+ months of waiting. Management has been absolutely no help. We moved out in August 2015 and planned to have the checks mailed four ways. The checks never came even though we were told the checks were sent. About two months later we request to have a single check cut to one person that was in the area. After that The U had no record of us even living there. Management has said they no longer deal with deposits so we had to contact the corporate company Carmel Apartments that owns The U. Carmel told us to contact Greystar. Greystar said they would put a team on it to figure this out yet they have done nothing. Really do not know what else to say but The U/Carmel Apartments stole $800 dollars from us. Up to you if you want that to happen.,2016-03-18,Joseph D.
The U-Davis,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-u-apartments-davis,1.0,"You know what, I changed my mind. I was gracious with a 3 star because of the furniture and cleanliness. However, there is no guest parking except the few 9 to 6pm staff parking we can use after 6. But on a three day weekend the complex thinks it was okay to park more dang construction equipment in those few spots. My guests shouldn't have to park on 2nd street, because The U doesn't care about their tenants. Don't live here. There are other clean places that actually care about you.

Ps. The bike racks are only bolted, not welded. An entire rack was easily unbolted and every bike was stolen.",2016-02-12,Anna P.
The U-Davis,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-u-apartments-davis,1.0,"I just want to say that the staff here is nice. but my complaint is regarding all the construction work and amenities that we weren't provided with. 

First of all, construction began at 7:30 AM every day, despite the fact that the apartment management workers informed me they should not begin until 8:30 AM. And the worst part, it was every single day for weeks, right next to my room's window. Imagine waking up to hammering banging noises and construction workers blasting their music every single morning. I do not pay rent to be waken up by construction noises and workers yelling outside my window. 

Second, basically EVERYTHING that we were offered during the signing process of the lease were not available for use for many months during my lease. I signed the lease thinking I will have access to the gym, tanning, and study room the whole year. But no. Construction again. and the worst part is they did not lower the rent or compensate the residents at all in any way. 
We signed the lease, and the rent we pay included all the amenities that were shown to us at the beginning. But in the middle of our lease, they simply said ""construction!"" and closed everything off to the residents. That is very unreasonable, especially since they did not compensate for these things in any way at all. Very unfair to those who pay rent. 

Third, the mold was SO GROSS. I am not sure if this was an issue everywhere, or just because of my apartment location, but we had mold EVERYWHERE. Even if i keep my window open, mold just grew all over the walls. The maintenance people tried to help us, but honestly made no difference. Extremely grossed out by the fact that nothing was done after they ""tried to fix the problem."" If I get any safety deposit taken away because of the molding, I will be EXTREMELY upset. oh, and they have lots of bugs too. gross.

Fourth, parking situation was a big fat joke. I paid so much money to park at my own apartment. Yet so many random people will park in my spot. If i total all the times I had to sit in my car for the cars in my spot to get towed, or wait for the owner to show up, I can easily say I waited at least 10 hours total. And things like this would happen sometimes at like 2 AM in the morning. I complained to the office multiple times, but they just said ""oh, get the car towed!"" It usually takes like an hour total for the tow truck to show up, and then get the car towed away. Do they really expect me to wait an entire hour every time someone parks in my spot? They need to come up with a better parking system, because seriously I paid hundreds of dollars over the months to park in a stupid spot super far from my apartment, that was ALWAYS taken by some other car. 


Overall, I was extremely unhappy with my living condition (especially the last few months). One step out of my own apartment door, and there were workers EVERYWHERE, boxes EVERYWHERE, and construction equipment just scattered all along the hall way. They would cut wood with some electric saw thing right outside our door, which was SUPER loud, and left dusty wood EVERYWHERE. There was no gym access for the longest time, construction was so loud, the mold was disgusting, the parking was terrible, and living at the U was uncomfortable.

I really hope they put in to consideration all these amenities and loud noises we had to go through, because I am going to be extremely upset if I don't get the majority of my safety deposit back. I think the apartments owe us that much.",2015-08-30,Anna K.
The U-Davis,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-u-apartments-davis,1.0,"AVOID THIS APARTMENT! Go elsewhere n save yourself some money. They raised $300ish for the small 10*11room for the renovation. Why don't you guys just rob?

First, this apartment management is a joke. We had roommate changes twice this year. The office said we could bring the lease back home to have everyone sign him off, the next day they said no no you guys must come over to sign the new guy on. I moved in here because the university village was collecting garbages weekly right out of your door. Then the U said no no we dont do that.  

Secondly, they are only kind to potential tenants. I was in hurry to an interview and I needed to print out a copy of my resume cu it ran out of copies. Then I for got to bring some paper. I asked the office if I could borrow 2 pieces of paper.The lady with her dog, TIFFANY, said to me ""why couldnt you go back and get some paper"" REALLY? It's just 2 pieces of paper! I had to explain to her them she thought about it for seconds! REALLY?! I explained my situation to you! Then she finally hand me 2 pieces of paper.

Thirdly, one of the running equipment was broken for months. I never knew if it was fixed or not, I just stopped going to their gym. Construction started going on early this year, and now it's still on.

Fourthly, whoever had this idea of putting the huge super bright lights around garbage can is an idiot! Those super duper bright lights make me hard to fall asleep since March! 

Fifthly, they turned this apartment into smoke free! WTH! Do it with the new tenants not with us who even signed the lease with the previous company! 

Sixthly,there was once I was out of town leaving my dog at home for 4 days. My dog got angry leaving her alone, though I have my housemate to take her out sometimes. She found my tissues and turned them into small pieces all over the room. I came back after driving 6 hrs from LA, I just wanted some good sleep n would clean up after I wake up.Then the maintenance guy came in to do an inspection. He woke me up n saw my messy room without saying anything. The next day I receive a notice saying I need to clean the room or I would be evicted from the apartment. Are you kidding me? Those were just pieces of tissues! It's not making muds flies or smells! Its none of your business anyway! 

Seventhly, they are just selfish. Be aware they charge you late fee of $50. They stopped accepting online credit card payment after the first month! So inconvenient!  It was in Dec or Jan, I forgot to pay my rent before the fifth cuz it was a weekend n I was just too tired coming back from bay area.  I went to the office on the night of the fifth. I was trying to drop off my deposit to the drop off box. It was dark, I used my phone light and saw nothing in the box n it was opened at the bottom. Since they moved their office into the studio, i thought maybe they dont use the dropoff box anymore. I waited the next morning, went in to pay sharply at 10am when they opened. I explained situation n what i thought last night but TIFFANY still charged me late fee. My friends who lived in the west village all had a bad time with her, n all my roommates here have had bad experience with her. They way she looks at you made me uncomfortable feeling like she checked out on you.

With a 10*11 sized room I'm paying $500 a month now, but after the renovation, they gonna charge you $800ish . It doesnt worth it here. I would like to rate the U negative 5 stars if possible.",2015-08-06,Chloe H.

The location is ideal for anyone thinking of attending UT. I'm a bit surprised by some of the reviews on here it's student accomadation not the Intercontinental Hotel. The WiFi was great, the pool gets the sun most of the day and is great for chilling out during the day & meeting new people. In terms of the rooms you can make it into whatever you want and the kitchen appliances have all been upgraded to a better level (although I would reccommend not cooking & eating WhatABurger across the road) The majority of the residents I met seemed happy with Villas.

Update: they have finally said they will have my window fixed but they've told me that before 8 months ago, so who knows if that'll happen.

I lived here for 2 years purely for convenience. I went to the Communications School and it was just 2 blocks away. This was the ONLY thing I liked about The Villas. The amenities mentioned were NEVER working when I wanted them to. The ""free"" printer was a very small standard printer for the entire complex that was out of ink or not working more often than it was, although the office staff had a great, functioning commercial printer. The hot tub was not HOT until the last 4 months of my two years living here. Several of my friends had their cars broken into the secure lot. Worse yet, the internet in the evening around midterms and finals was unbearably slow and several nights I had to leave to find a place that was open late at night and offered free wifi. 

Aside from the amenities that seldom worked, my least favorite part of the day-to-day living at The Villas was the nasty, nasty floors. Each unit has tile which is almost impossible to keep clean because the outdoor/indoor hallways that lead to the garage are dirty dirty dirty. Even after mopping, I couldn't ever walk around my house with my shoes off aside from in the carpeted bedroom.

The interior looks nice, but won't hold a/c so expect to spend a fortune on electricity. Hot tub didn't work in the winter, couldn't use the pool in the summer because of the paint job, so I don't know why I paid for it.

You can have good parties there I guess?? Surprisingly quiet for a west campus apartment in spite of all the parties. Expect to see the aftermath of a good party wherever you go though. Rank barf, beer cans, broken eggs, just all-in-all random junk. Basically you don't get whatever you pay for. You pay for people to do their jobs but for some reason they can't.

Villas on Guadalupe,https://www.yelp.com/biz/villas-on-guadalupe-austin,1.0,"If  I could give this place negative stars, I would. 

The most problems I have EVER had with an apartment complex.

Don't believe them and record EVERYTHING. I mean from the moment you walk in to your apartment, have one of the staff walk in with you as you RECORD what the apartment looks like. I was told my carpet would be BRAND new when I moved in and that was a huge lie. I think frat guys lived in my complex because it seemed there were beer/throw up stains all over the place.  

The place is loud, they don't really care about security. My friend had someone knock on her door at 3am who turned out to be a serial killer on the loose. 

And trust me, this people will try to get all they money they can out of you. 
When I left my apartment, a year later I received call from a collection agency saying I owed money because I left my apartment dirty. It's funny because I spent two days making sure the place was spotless, even steam cleaning the carpet because I knew they would try and blame me from the previous tenants. 

Well, I call to see what mysterious findings they found after I moved out. They claimed I had trash bags, food in the fridge, in the cabinets, hangers, and PHONEBOOKS lying around. This is how I knew something was absolutely wrong, I haven't owned seem a phonebook since I was seven. I knew this couldn't be my apartment so it dawned on me which apartment number they had me at ..and it was a completely wrong apartment number, and to top it off they say I switched apartment mid year! It is pathetic the lies they throw! 

Keep in mind this is their fault and it is on my credit record. I call the next day and surprisingly all the managers are busy. I have called 6-7 times and every time the manager seems to be super swamped and they ask that I call back at a better time. What kind of business is this? I have to keep calling to maybe be lucky enough to find them on a day they want to sort this out? 

FINALLY I get a hold of someone, and when I do they say they can't do anything about it and they I SHOULD call the collection agency to figure it out. Something that is not MY FAULT, but THEIR FAULT and I have to be the one to fix it? 

Seriously guys, save yourself the headaches and the credit harm and go somewhere else. I have never written a review but they are screwing with my credit, my ability to purchase a house and yet they will do nothing about it.

This is my third year living here. And no, it's not like I'm some die-hard fan of the Villas. In fact, I've had my fair share of complaints (come on, Fiji, I swear some of y'all have built in megaphones). Basically, I've been out of the country every move-out date, so staying put seemed the easiest option.

Yes, it's loud. Yes, there are parties (join em!). Yes, the wifi can be faster. No, I wouldn't touch the hot-tub with a 10 foot pole. 

But the staff is so awesome. They fulfill maintenance requests within a day. They'll answer all of your questions without hesitation. They'll do random free breakfasts, free hot dog days, and on exam week, they'll deliver little care packages to your door with snacks. And the annual crawfish broils? I've heard some people move in just for those. I think they had about 600lbs of crawfish for the last party. Bad-friggin-ass.

Look, if you're looking at these reviews, you're probably an undergrad looking for a very polished, friendly-staffed, clean, inexpensive, relatively quiet, large apartment within a block walking distance of campus.

- great amenities: free Wi-Fi (not slow), free coffee machine, business office w/free printing & comp access, pool (24 hrs), great back-to-school free stuff
- good maintenance: it's not PERFECT but it can be compared to the maintenance that is provided at the UT dorms. They take care of things timely and during move-in it's a little slow but that's to be expected.
- some noise level: it's West Campus, and I haven't had any trouble yet with any heavy noises (but I have also lived in Whitis Court the year they had construction on BMC so I'm not affected that easily)
- friendly staff: it sounds like it depends on the staff team that is here when you live here but I've only had friendly and helpful staff encounters
- stove, microwave, dishwasher, washer & dryer included in one complex 
- sketchy elevator but works nevertheless
- guest parking on roof of garage for up to 3 days
- they throw a lot of activities like a crawfish broil and finals goodie bags

I'm sharing a room with my roommate so it's ~$447 a month. We share the complex with a girl in another room and someone living in the loft. Loft prices are are $400-500 but single rooms run starting around $800. I would suggest doubling up in a room because that is more economic and makes the amenities worth it and I'm willing to overlook tiny things like a few ants behind the stove.

The Venue on Guadalupe,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-venue-on-guadalupe-apartments-austin?osq=venue+at+guadalupe,4.0,"After reading so many negative reviews of The Venue, I noticed that many were older posts from 2011-13.  While I realize that many points are valid, we have found it a good spot for our son.  He moved in last year as a sophomore.  He did double-up in 2-bedroom unit and liked it so much that he renewed for junior year.  We missed the ""early bird specials"" last year so we have already resigned for his senior year.  The convenience of not having to move out for 2 weeks in July is a huge plus.  There were some minor cleaning issues when he first moved in but those were quickly resolved.  After reading so many horror stories from other Texas Parents, I feel we have a good situation.  The location is convenient and the units are spacious and modern.  Sharing a bedroom is a great way of reducing costs and yet the size is plenty large for 2 people.  We leased furniture and have been pleased with the quality/style/value.  The kitchen is plenty big and updated for guys to do basic meal prep.  Having a full sized washer and dryer in the unit is a very convenient feature! The parking garage does have small, tight spaces, but we were able to get assigned an more accessible spot when we renewed.  Elevators are out occasionally, but my son has never complained.  The front office staff is young and inexperienced but we have made connections now with one person in particular which assures our concerns are handled quickly and satisfactorily.  The online portal for rent payment is a convenient feature, but you do need to monitor it regularly for accuracy.  Overall, I do not feel this property deserves such negative ratings.  It goes to show that most people are more likely to document complaints than to tout positives.  If you are looking for safe, convenient, ""affordable"" (relatively speaking!), comfortable rental unit near campus, I can highly recommend The Venue.  Getting nicer, newer quality, will cost at least 2x what we pay per month.",2016-10-29,Bryan H.
The Venue on Guadalupe,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-venue-on-guadalupe-apartments-austin?osq=venue+at+guadalupe,1.0,"Don't let this be that one Yelp review that you force yourself to ignore because of how enchanted you were by your visit. I spent years at The Venue--for the convenience while going to grad school--and I still cringe thinking about it.

While The Venue isn't the worst apartment complex in the world, it's absolutely not worth the rent.

It's the type of place that cleans the property for a single month, just long enough to get a few people to sign an overpriced lease, then immediately jumps right into months of pure neglect, investing all resources into spamming its residents into renewing with referral prizes and ""early bird specials"" where your rent goes up by ONLY $300/month.

All of the key management and staff is located in the sister property, The Villas. They'll sell that to you like it's a perk, and tell you that you ""have access to all The Villas amenities,"" but you have no more access than any rando walking the street. With that said, they DO NOT care about The Venue property.

While there are a few nice employees who obviously have no control over the problems, many of the main people in charge lack any form of respect. They seem to assume that every resident is 17 years old, and you're sure to get tired of patronizing tones and power trips very quickly.

The little patch of grass that the entire property is forced to take their pets out to (unless you favor the park nearby) is seldom mowed and absolutely ridden with dog feces. Assuming most people were too afraid to walk through a field of ""land mines,"" I asked the management (twice) to move the doggie bag dispenser closer for easier access, but nothing ever happened.

The gym isn't just small, it's completely ignored. You don't realize how bad it is until you actually use it. ALL of the rusty, nasty equipment has sat broken for over TWO YEARS: the elliptical has a broken arm that is always either missing or dangling, one of the two treadmills sticks, the resistance machine sticks on both sides and has a missing handle, none of the 3 benches lie flat, none of the TVs work correctly.

The elevators are broken about every other week, and sometimes remain broken for weeks at a time. The garbage chutes are often stopped up and overflowing, there's sometimes vomit in the halls and/or urine in the staircase, and the garage (where you pay $85/month for parking) is poorly regulated and chock full of spots that most cars won't ever be able to fit in. 

Maintenance is so straight-up lazy that it's almost laughable. Half the time, they would mark off work orders as complete that they did not even address -- it happened so many times that I just gave up on some things being fixed and prayed for my lease to end. For some ""emergency maintenance"" calls, they would say they were coming and never would.

Whatever the case, make sure you RECORD every single maintenance phone call you make, because management tried to convince me that they could possibly charge me for my CEILING bubbling up with water-- my upstairs neighbor's fault -- because even though the maintenance guy walked into my apartment after an emergency phone call and looked at it - the work order (and apparently my neighbor's mistake) ""was not logged onto the computer"" and ""phone calls don't count."" 

Of course, there's also the classic: ""Afraid that's mold? We'll throw some paint on it.""

***And a warning for everyone moving out: after reading so many horrid reviews on Yelp, I called Greystar ""just in case"" to see if I had any unpaid balance. I DID. Even though The Venue pesters you for a forwarding address when you move out, they never sent the bill to my new apartment.

They'll take you on a little tour and show you how lovely the place is. The units are nice, they have great amenities and a perfect location but it is not worth the money you will be paying every month. There are apartments across the street that are just as nice but they are almost $200 less! I feel like I'm getting robbed every month. I'm not sure of what they're doing with all that money. They're certainly not using it to maintain the apartments that have thin wall & broken appliances. Now that I think about it, I think they used a lot of it to update the leasing office. So sad.

In addition to that, the management is HORRIBLE. Once you sign that lease all that love and affection disappears and all they want is the money. If something is not working out, instead of trying to fix the problem they will say how great the place is compared to other apartments in West Campus. They don't communicate with one another and half of them don't know how to do their job. They are actually kind of mean. It's so sad.",2013-07-11,Sunny K.
The Venue on Guadalupe,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-venue-on-guadalupe-apartments-austin?osq=venue+at+guadalupe,1.0,"Alright, so I contemplated for a while about writing this review on The Venue, but after much thought I feel like people should know about what they are signing into for a year. 
 At first, I was extremely excited to live at The Venue, for it is an ""urban student place to live."" I liked the fact that it looked pretty luxurious, nice granite counter-tops, wooded flooring, carpet, nice bathrooms, having a garage parking lot and an elevator that helps when caring loads of things. 
Well, the first week in, I knew living here was going to be a heck of a ride. 
On my floor there were guys claiming the hallway as theirs, screaming at the top of their lungs rolling down it with their computer chairs. Within a month the elevator broke down. MAY YOU BE CLEARLY AWARE OF THIS, IT BREAKS DOWN EVERY TWO MONTHS! 
I mean, I get the whole ""don't be lazy and just take the stairs"" idea, but seriously, let's get real. After a hard and long day when all you want to do is plop onto your bed you have to climb stairs to get to your room because the elevator is broken again. Other days when you have groceries to take to your floor and your dreading it because the elevator isn't working. 
Anyway, enough about the elevator. 
Let's talk about the other negative occurrences I had to live with.
Again, on my floor these other dudes and maybe even the same ones, smoked pot every week to where the whole floor could smell it. It gets pretty annoying having to smell pot remnants. 
On top of dysfunctional elevators, frat guys yelling down the hall/smoking pot, you have to deal with CRAPPY front desk assistants and PAPER THIN walls. 
1. The acoustics within each apartment are ridiculous! You can hear everything from the outside, and you can hear everything going down in the hallway. If your neighbors are loud enough then you can hear them in their own apartment. Seriously? 
You probably won't have restful sleep when ACL or SXSW are happening. The Venue is right across the Spider House. A venue for music/poetry/comedy and also a coffee shop. It's great for when you are in the need of a cappuccino or  latte but stinks when all you want to do is sleep at night. 
You get your own private concert alllll night long. You also get to hear all the delightful poets slamming their words away into the mic and into your apartment. IT'S GREAT!!!......  Oh man, and when bands play, they play. 
Even when there are no events going on, the loud people from the villas  (apartment that is sister to the venue) that are out and about are louddddd! You can hear all their screams and shenanigans. 
Anyway, I think you get the point. It's LOUD, and you aren't even living in West Campus. 
On top of that you have the MOST FRIENDLY staff at the front office, so excited to hear your question with a smile....
There have been countless times where I have gone in to ask questions or receive packages and the only thing they want you to do is get out ASAP so they can go back to probably looking at their NEWSFEED on facebook. I definitely believe they need training in friendly costumer service and maybe more sleep in general. 
So you get all this for 1,024 plus parking per room. WHAT? yes, I share a room and have to pay about 500 plus utilities. 
Good things about the Venue you ask?
Well, I can say that I DO like the fact that the apartments are hotel/dorm style looking WHEN it comes to the set up of the hallways because you do get to have the safeness of that setting. Everyone has an access card to the facility which is pretty great. 
Its nice to have a little personal gym. iT'S NOT GREAT, but it's useful. 
The walk isn't too bad to campus. 
And... well. I guess a nice a spacious living room.
Other than that, I think you are better off getting a place in hyde park (north campus) or west campus.
Good riddance to the Venue!",2014-05-26,Arlene S.
The Venue on Guadalupe,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-venue-on-guadalupe-apartments-austin?osq=venue+at+guadalupe,3.0,"I've lived here for a year and really enjoyed it.
The location is great, the interior is very luxurious, They have real wood flooring (if it's fake they fooled me), & the enclosed hallways with elevators are nice as well. 

Maintenance is very quick and the management staff were very nice.
Our fridge broke at the beginning of the year but they replaced it right away with a brand new one which was a plus.

 The walls and doors are very thick so you can't here your neighbors and never had an issue with loud noises.

There were a couple of cons though...

The elevators broke down almost 10 times within the year and would be broken for days and one time it was over a week. I lived on the 6th floor and was extremely frustrated because it's almost like a workout every time I came home and not in a good way. carrying grocery's was a bitch and after a long day at class or work the last thing you want to do is climb 7 flights of stairs and walk in your front door out of breath. 

The parking garage gate breaks often as well. 
One time early in the morning before the office was open I was leaving for work and the gate was opening and closing like it was stuck and I was trapped for about 20 mins. Finally the gate opened wide enough and as I went though the gate slammed into my car causing pretty bad damage and was extremely late for work. I went to the leasing office to tell them and of course they are protected against anything and everything due to the contract. 

Hope this was helpful!",2014-07-03,Allie W.
The Venue on Guadalupe,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-venue-on-guadalupe-apartments-austin?osq=venue+at+guadalupe,1.0,"If you do not enjoy peace and quiet when you sleep, by all means live here!!

When the trash chute gets filled with a certain amount of trash, the machine will NOT stop making noise until it is cleared. The single greatest flaw is that all of the trash is compiled into one area from the entire 5 floors, which is unfortunately right next to my  room on the 2nd floor. The machine makes a high pitched noise that is irritatingly loud and impossible to tune out. I have lost many hours of sleep because of this in the past already.

I have already filed several service request/complaints on the website and no one has bothered to respond to me since the new management has taken over. I even posted on their facebook page and they proceeded to delete it without voicing my conerns. I called the front desk about my problem and the girl had the audacity to say that ""only I have been the one that has been complaining"", and that "" she went and checked and nothing was wrong"". Does she THINK I am deaf? I also do not want to believe that just because there is only ONE person complaining about a situation that it is NOT important enough to fix? What kind of reasoning is that? What kind of impression are you making as a management to your customers?

There will surely not be any more business from me or from anyone I know from the future due to the low quality of customer care services. You would expect higher expectations of a place that markets itself on ""high quality student living"". I also would have thought that maintenance would be available on weekends, but I guess not.",2012-04-30,Darren L.
The Venue on Guadalupe,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-venue-on-guadalupe-apartments-austin?osq=venue+at+guadalupe,1.0,"When I first moved in here, the place was great because it was under the management of BMOC and the main guy Jon; service was good and they generally got our repairs done and I could handle the noise. But now this place has changed management and it's been an ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE experience afterwards. I have literally filed 5 service requests and they have done nothing; the one time they sent a guy over, they had to ""order the parts"" and now it is 2 months later and they still do not have the parts. Calling the front office is like talking to a machine as it seems like there is a new receptionist every 2 weeks and they generally don't do anything except recite company policy. 

Furthermore, they have not only increased our rent for the next year, but no longer allow us to split the rent in an uneven manner between myself and my roomates (aka everyone has to pay the same, and WE have to split the differences ourselves afterwards). I also can no longer pay my rent online like before without a $20 service charge, which was never the case before using the exact same website and payment procedure. What's even worse is that they did not notify anyone of this and when I tried to pay my rent at the end of the month, only then did they say ""oh by the way, extra $20"" and when pressed for a reason, they hide behind the good ole' ""it's company policy sir"". Really. 

The gym has not been cleaned in at least a month and pretty much you have to go to Gregory if you do not want to feel disgusting afterwards. The front door on the south tower has been broken for 75% of this semester and they have hired new cleaning staff that does not clean nearly as often as before. 

All in all, the apartment itself is really nice with granite countertops and a spacious living room, but everything around it and all the circumstances surrounding my lease here have made it an unpleasant experience. If I am going to be paying top-dollar for an apartment, I would have expected much much more. Come on Venue, it's called customer service; you used to know how to do it, but not anymore - safe to say I will not be returning here next year. The new Greystar management is horrible - STAY AWAY!

The Venue on Guadalupe,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-venue-on-guadalupe-apartments-austin?osq=venue+at+guadalupe,4.0,"This place has been pretty great for the year that I have lived here. I have had very few problems, and they are all small ones. The elevator breaks pretty frequently, but I'm not sure how that can even be fixed. The only other issue I have had is with service requests. When I do put in a service request with just one item on it, it is fixed quickly. However, when I use the online form and ask for several things to be fixed (light bulbs in two different rooms and the drawer in my fridge) they only fix the first thing listed. I don't think it's intentional, it seems like it has more to do with the reporting system. Just be sure to submit multiple requests if you have multiple issues. As far as noise goes, within the building there isn't much of an issue. My apartment faces into the pool which means it also faces Guadalupe which is where most of the noise comes from, in the form of traffic. This is a non issue for me but is something to consider if you're concerned about noise.",2014-07-27,Cat H.
The Venue on Guadalupe,https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-venue-on-guadalupe-apartments-austin?osq=venue+at+guadalupe,1.0,"I wholeheartedly agree with the reviews by J.C., Bill H. and Darren L.. At first glance, the units appear very luxurious, but I have had major issues with my apartment, with the common areas of the property, and tenants--such that I would not recommend the Venue to my worst enemy!  The property management is beyond awful.

Since I have lived here, one tenant set off fireworks and discharged a fire extinguisher in my hallway (requiring evacuation in the middle of the night).  Other tenants were using the closed in hallway as a hot-box for smoking marijuana; I repeatedly complained and was told by Venue to call the police; I did several times, and in retaliation, the residents showed up with a gun to intimidate me.  Most recently, two inebriated tenants had a screaming match in the hallway in the middle of the night, one saying the other had threatened him with a knife, and saying he was going to go get his 12 gauge.  I filed police reports following all three of these incidents, but Venue staff refused to investigate or do anything to the residents.  After the gun incident, I threatened to sue and to assuage me, cameras were installed on my floor.  The wires were torn down by other residents and when I requested they be repaired, Venue refused.  The cameras are still up, but non-operational.  Two of my neighbors have had packages stolen from in-front of their doors since then, and have also expressed a desire to have them reactivated.

In my unit, there was an extreme mold problem that required the drywall to be cut away in large sections around two air vents.  I had to take pictures, screamed to high heaven and threatened a lawsuit for the repair to be done properly.  They did not tarp the area, so I had drywall and paint-spray particles all over all my stuff.  As another testament to their maintenance staff's lack of professionalism, when I complained about my dryer vent being clogged, the staff came in with their gas powered leaf-blower and blew the lint out with it--the whole unit smelled like gas and the walls near the dryer has a gas-residue that I had to clean up myself.  

I agree with the review that says this place is slapped together like a cheap mobile home.  When you go to replace the air filter, you can see splintered 2x4s behind the drywall, and no insulation.  My unit is just next to the trash chute, and when the trash gets backed up, the smell drifts into my unit through this space in the wall!  The hallways also echo to such a degree that I am always awoken at 2:15 when my drunk neighbors get home from the bars.  My fridge's water-dispenser has never worked (complained numerous times), and there is no water pressure for the hot water in my bathroom sink (cold has great pressure, but who wants to wash their hands in cold water?).

If you are considering renting here, I strongly suggest you visit the property and walk around both towers during the middle of the semester, since they tend to keep the common areas in good repair around the beginning of each term when they are getting a lot of potential residents visiting.  After the semester begins, maintenance and cleaning of common areas falls off a cliff!

Here are just a few of the things you can expect to see: broken glass bottles and eggs thrown from the second floor pool deck to the front sidewalk (poorly swept up if at all), beer bottles and cans strewn about every Thursday, Friday and Saturday (which are never cleaned up until Monday at the earliest), dog poop never removed from the dog park on site (I walk my dogs across the street near Spider House for this reason), DAILY spills in the elevators that make the tile floor sticky and disgusting (this is mopped about once a week), and garbage and broken glass regularly in about half of the garage spaces.  The gym has never had any cleaning solution provided, so the equipment is sweaty and gross (and not regularly cleaned by maintenance).  Months ago, some idiot broke glass in the pool, and I have since been too afraid to swim in it (it was reported to the Venue, but the pool has not been drained, so beware!)

For nearly $1K monthly per bedroom (with parking, water, trash and pest fees), I expected a lot more. When my lease expires this summer, I am out of here!!!",2013-02-19,Layla G.

Granted, I never could have afforded it not for the fact that I wasn't paying for it myself, had a roommate, and had gotten an awesome deal on the place.    

If you have the money to spend, you get the best.  Granite counter tops, hardwood floors, stainless steel appliances, spacious room plans, giant windows, and garden tubs.  Not to mention the fact that the grounds itself have a very nice gym, rooftop pool, elevators, underground parking, and electronic access for extra safety.  

I never had any problems with noise, and the few incidents that did take place were dealt with by the leasing office with grace.  I love the guys in the front office.  They find that boundary between professional but still friendly and down to earth.    

All in all, I have very fond memories of The Venue.  In fact, I even gave a mom and her two daughters a tour of it when the office was on break once and highly recommended it.

1) if I ever have problems, the staff is SO QUICK to help! They are really nice people, and they aren't in it just for the money like many other apartment complexes close-by. I have many friends that live in West Campus and they are always complaining about how it would take weeks for something to get fixed. 

2) The garage is safe. There are problems with the gate every now and then, but this is an underground covered garage. They also have security that takes rounds. 

3) The complex is safe. You have to scan a pass to get into the garage and to get into the complex. If you have guests over, they have a nice system so that they can call your cell phone and you can give them access via your cell phone. That way you don't have to walk all the way down to get them.

4) Location. Trudy's in the backyard. Spiderhouse in the backyard. So many restaurants, CVS, a grocery store in the backyard, and close to campus. I wish there were more buses that ran to campus. I usually take the 1L or 1M or 22 if I need to get somewhere on campus. Or I walk to campus and take the 40 acres.

5) The staff. A very responsive and friendly staff. They always give courtesy notices well in advance, they set up a continental breakfast for all the residents during final exams, and they keep the entire apartment so tidy and clean. Smells like Lemon Pledge all the time.

6) Price. I pay $850/mo (after electricity, water, etc.) for a 2/2 that is like 1050 sqft. That's pretty big. 850 sounds pricey, but that includes internet and cable and a washer/dryer. It isn't great, but it isn't terrible.

I don't love living at the Venue b/c:

1) it's not West Campus. It's North Campus. If you're a social bug, then you probably wanna stick with West Campus where there's more activity. I don't really care for that b/c I can invite friends to Trudy's and we can share some drinks.",2010-12-21,Neil And Manik A.

The management, Josh and Clifton, are really friendly and get to know their residents on a first name basis.

I moved out July of 2015, in October 2015 I received word from my guarantor (they had not contacted me even though I had given them a forward address, they had my email and phone number on file) that I was being charged to replace the common area furniture. 

The furniture had normal wear and tear after five years of not being replaced, and eight different tenants but since we were the final four we were being charged to replace it. I disputed the charges and sent a check for what I would pay for (things in the bedroom) and receive no further word from management so I assumed the mattered was handled.

Fast forward to today seven months later, no further correspondence from Greystar or UTC, I was temporarily denied a housing application because of a ""housing debt"" on my record that turns out to be this matter. This is very unprofessional as I have sent payment and disputed claims but received NO COMMUNICATION from Greystar or UTC before today and after the final email in October.

I lived here as a last resort because it couldn't get housing on campus. The residents here are UMD students but also students at Howard and other schools in the city who commute in using the Metro. UMD students can commute to campus using a free (with student ID) university shuttle. It's walkable or bikeable, but I generally didn't. If you have a car, parking here is expensive and not worth it. I left mine at the university, which was more cost effective but also inconvenient.

Rooms here are mostly four-bedroom apartments. Each bedroom is leased individually, which is helpful. Entry is annoyingly but understandably restricted due to security concerns. The room I lived in wasn't particularly well cared for, partially because the roommates tended to break things but partially because management didn't seem to care much. Rent is not low.

Individual leases mean that most roommates are happenstance partnerships and don't know each other, and by and large, the building wasn't a particularly friendly community. There are shopping options in the neighborhood, but they aren't great. I never went out much because there were several shootings in the immediate area (including one personal dispute that ended in violence inside The Towers) while I was there.

There are better housing options. On-campus buildings are sometimes not the greatest, but The Towers are not any nicer or cheaper, and being on campus has its perks. There are other private housing complexes that are closer to UMD, cheaper, or nicer. If you're a student whose other options fell through this place will do, but I spent a semester and a summer here and I can only say that I wish I had some good memories, but really I don't.",2013-09-21,John B.

Management is extremely rude and unprofessional. They will tell you one thing and do another. The student assistants are also extremely rude which makes it difficult to take care of normal business. 

The security system is a joke. Office Swann and Ms. Gloria are the only relatively decent guards on staff. They care about the students and their safety. The other guards sit around and chill all day. There are multiple break ins which is quite baffling since there is an electronic key entry to the floors and apartment units. 

You spend almost a $1000.00 monthly for a room. Tenants are not allowed to choose their roommates. The roommate matching system is a joke. 

Management does not make sure that units are clean upon move in. My apartment unit was utterly, filthy and disgusting upon move in. I was appalled! 

The maintenance staff is pathetic. The air conditioner broke down in my unit and none of them fixed the system unit stating that since some air was coming out of the vent, that the unit was sufficient. WHAT?!!!! Ray the maintenance staff lead is the best thing this apartment has going for them. He is super friendly and works with the students to assure that all appliances are working properly in the apartments. 

Drugs among students are major. My friend visited town and couldn't believe how open and prevalent they were which makes it unsafe.

The Towers at UTC - Maryland,https://www.yelp.com/biz/towers-at-university-town-center-hyattsville?osq=towers+at+utc,4.0,"I don't know what it's like now, but I lived here from 2010-2011 when I attended Howard University.

I loved it. Never had any pest issues, a million freebies (free food downstairs, free $200 metro card, super close to the Prince Georges Metro Station, across the street from the mall/potential job opportunities, within walking distance to two grocery stores, restaurants and a movie theatre right down in the courtyard). Management was nice, security could have definitely done a better job -- people snuck in all the time. 

It is definitely more convenient to live here if you DON'T have a car because parking is prohibitively expensive. I believe back then it was like $125 a month. A friend of mine used to park waaaaaay down the hill, down the street for like $25 a month though, so if you're willing to walk you may have a less expensive parking option (the walk is not very safe at night, though. I especially wouldn't recommend it for young women.).

Never had a problem with the Wifi either. I think the worst part of it all was my roommates. One was a...love addict, who kept the door open so you could hear her and her...friend. And then she had an infant that would cry all the time. The other was a pothead... the other was nice, but ALWAYS had her boyfriend over at all times of the night so I couldn't even walk out of my room at night into the suite common area in my pajamas comfortably.

Shuttle service back then was basically nonexistent but I believe since I left they have a shuttle that actually goes to Howard.

There are probably less expensive options near Howard but this was the best option for me -- safe, relatively inexpensive, and convenient to so many different amenities. 

Time from UTC to Howard on the green line: about 20 minutes. Not including the walk, or the shuttle once you get to the Shaw-Howard stop. (You could probably map this out using Google Maps Transit though, it may be different now)",2014-03-07,Kali C.

The Towers at UTC is a great place to stay. I only have few grievances. First, there is no shuttle service during the summer. I think the smaller shuttle should run at least every two hours, and it should hit points of interest like Howard, the metro, etc. We are very far from points of interest in the DMV, and I wouldn't mind paying extra in rent if there were constant shuttle services. Second, I do not like how they refuse to open the windows further than the six inches it opens. I like my view and would like fresh air to come into my room. Third, I do not like hour the elevator randomly dings in the middle of the night. Fourth, I do not like the pool hours. Most people are at school or work and cannot enjoy the amenity that was a selling point. However, these things do not outweigh the bad here. I love the study room, the game room, and the exercise room. I think they are well up to date and give residents chances to interact. I love that I have my own room and bathroom. I live that maintenance fixes things within a day or two at most. I like the programs they have. Towers at UTC is a great place to live.",2015-06-29,Diamond C.

The Towers at UTC - Maryland,https://www.yelp.com/biz/towers-at-university-town-center-hyattsville?osq=towers+at+utc,3.0,"I lived at the UTC as a UMD undergrad for almost 2 years. For a UMD student, definitely is not the best choice. I would suggest the Courtyards. For other college students, this may be a good choice for you. Overall the UTC is not a bad place to live. At least I've never seen any roaches, mice, ants, etc. There are trash chutes on everyfloor with recycling bins and laundry units in each apartment. UTC is a very convenient apt. Close to metro, shuttle to UMD and Howard University comes right to the front of the building, and there is a mall across the street, and a few restaurants in the courtyard (I gained 20lbs living here lol). UTC is best for people who don't have anyone else to live with. My first year I paid $799 a month, and everything was included including cable, but they only gave you a $100 limit on utilities so if you go over they charge you, but I had 3 other roommates, so yep that equalled to over $3200 a month collectively and UTC is def not worth that. If you have at least two other friends you are considering living with, your best choice is to either just get a regular apt off campus, not student living, or go on Craig's List and find a house for rent. You'll pay a lot less.

My first year (2010) I lived on the 4th floor in the leasing office building in a ""handicapped"" unit which I thought they would reserve for residents who needed such amenities, but nope they forced me to keep it. Room was dirty when I moved in, carpet was not new, dust galore, and bathroom wasn't clean. I did a thorough cleaning when I moved in, but silly me I excpected the unit to be cleaned before my arrival, but that was my fault because I moved in sight unseen not knowing any better because this was my first apartment experience. They try to make you believe that you cannot see your unit until you sign your lease which is completely bogus information. 

The following year they moved me into the second tower and my rent went down to $699 on the 14th floor, but when I moved into the place, there was old food in the fridge and freezer which stunk to high hell, Chicken bones in the dishwasher, yes CHICKEN BONES! There was a bunch of junk left in the hall closet. SO much that it almost spilled out into the hallway, but once we got rid of all that stuff, and finally got our dishwasher working, we were good. Oh yeah, maintenance can take a little long to fix things they don't deem important. You might have to put in several requests, but at least everything is done online. The maintenance guy at the time was Raymond, and if you caught him in the hallway, sometimes he'll come take a look at what needs to be fixed right away. He even gave me his cell phone number to reach him directly which I thought was nice at first, but this dude was a total CREEP! If he's still there, I wouldn't recommend having him in your apt while your roommates aren't home. He might even be the type to look in your underwear drawer when you're not home lol.

If you have good roommates, which mine were cool in both units for the most part, Towers at UTC can be pretty cool. The office staff can be rude and condescending like others have stated. Also, security keeps track of who's in your apt which is safe, but also can be annoying if you have multiple guests over at a time. Some of the more ""pressed"" security guards will turn your guests away if you have too many people over at a time, but there are ways around that. 

Make sure you PAY ATTENTION to the segment in your lease about move out! Clean and shampoo your carpet and have one of the staff check off that you have done this and whatever else is listed otherwise not only will you not get back your security deposit, they will actually try to bill you extra! The first time I didn't know so I got like $50 back, but the second time I cleaned my room to a TEE so I would not get the cleaning bill, but they still tried to charge me for an apt that was dirty when I moved in. Yes, they are that type of facility...

Oh yeah, the area isn't necessarily the best to travel alone in, someone did get stabbed right outside of our building...",2014-12-29,Ray M.

The walls are perfect to keep out noise and living on a top floor, I don't hear very much in the streets below. This means a lot to me since West Campus is usually extremely loud and can be a little much at times. I love the convenience of living in West Campus, not paying too much, and living only a 15 minute walk from all my classes (by the Texas Union). Maintainence requests are done promptly and there's monthly events held for all residents, which is cool when you have not gotten groceries yet and you are starving :-) The gym and pool are definitely awesome and there it is super easy to get around this complex.

Rio West,https://www.yelp.com/biz/rio-west-austin,1.0,"NOTE - If you're wondering why there's so few reviews here, it's because management keeps flagging / deleting the unfavorable ones (like this one, which had gotten deleted). 

I lived at Rio West from August 2013 til May 2015, and I've experienced several inconveniences along the way. 

On first visit, my roommates and I were extremely pleased with the property, as it filled almost all of our needs (4 bedrooms including 2 'double' bedrooms which could house 6 people, large living area, close to UT campus). On top of that, the model apartment they show is gorgeous. 

However, it only took waking into the management assigned apartment on my move-in day to feel ripped off. The biggest problem I had right away was the north wall of Rio West is located about 6 feet from the south wall of The Block next door. Stupid of me to not think this would be a problem, but looking out our window gave a beautiful view of the gray, lifeless wall of The Block. If you are unlucky enough to get stuck on the north facing side of Rio West, believe me - you need to buy extra lighting, as absolutely no sunlight will ever enter your apartment. Extremely dreary.

Fast forward a few months. In late 2013, some idiots broke the elevator call button on the 6th floor. Instead of fixing it, management decided to leave it so that you could not call the elevator up to the 6th floor, in punishment of the residents (this was clearly stated as their position in a letter they posted on everyone's doors). It was at least 4 or 5 months before management fixed the issue.

On the note of security, Rio West has none. Up until summer 2015, there was no card or code required to get into the building (note I believe this has changed). This rendered the public areas in the building extremely subject to idiocy and drunkenness. I can remember at least 10 occasions when there was piss (or worse things) in the elevators, up until one of the elevators effectively destroyed in (I believe) March 2015 (it appeared as if someone tried to hang from the ceiling, as the tiles had caved in and the metal of the ceiling was bent). 

Right outside Rio West are bike racks fit for about 20-30 bicycles. Trust me when I say they are NOT SAFE - I know of at least 3-4 bikes being stolen from there (as you can probably guess, there's no camera). 

The staff is actually not too bad, as maintenance issues are handled within a week and otherwise they are relatively hands off. One inconvenience is that they do not notify you of packages, which go sit in the leasing office and aren't available for pick up except in normal business hours. 

In the end, I would definitely not live here again. The only reason I re-signed my lease for a 2nd year was because I and my other roommates were spread in various corners of the US for internships in the summer between the 1st and 2nd year, and had no realistic ways of coordinating a move (especially as all west campus leases end July 31st and begin ~August 15, creating quite an awkward transition period).",2015-07-19,Nikhil J.

Rio West,https://www.yelp.com/biz/rio-west-austin,1.0,"No. Just no. Don't live here. Main problem - every single appliance they use is probably the cheapest one ever made. Washing machine has broken a few times since I moved in and leaked water all over the floor. Dryer takes 2 90 minutes cycles to actually dry a medium load of clothes. Dish washer leaves nasty sand-like residue on all your dishes (literally they go in cleaner than they come out) no matter what detergent you use. For the first HALF of our lease term, our water heater hardly worked. It took 4 maintenance requests and a hand delivered letter from Austin tenants council for them to actually fix it. Water bill will be about $100/month electricity about $300. Wifi doesn't work and you will need to use an ethernet cable (even though they advertise free wifi). There will be puke in the hallways at all time. It will always smell. The printer in the study room will be out of ink/toner for weeks at a time. The pool and gym are a joke, that's why no one ever uses them. Oh yeah and can't forget about the elevators of death. They make the scariest noises and many times the lights are completely busted so you have the option of lugging your groceries up 6 flights of stairs or getting into a pitch black elevator that is CLEARLY not in proper working condition. They went about 4 months with an overdue elevator inspection. They only RANDOMLY lock the lobby doors (they'll have them locked for about a week and then two months unlocked, 1 week locked, etc etc)  which makes it completely pointless to lock them in the first place, so you never know if you're going to need your key card or not. Oh yeah and even though you pay as much as everyone else, you might just get stuck with a crappy 2001 haire? TV. Everyone will come into your apartment and be like ""damn, why is yall's TV so ghetto compared to everyone else's"" ""BEATS ME!"" Unless you live on the 6th floor, you will have to deal with constant booooooomboomboom from your upstairs neighbors bowling or wrestling - that's what it sounds like they're doing since the floors and walls are paper thin. But even though every single resident has to deal with this, don't be surprised if they issue you a lease violation because your downstairs neighbors complained. 

Don't ever use their online system to pay rent. Not only is there a $15 ""convenience"" fee to use it, The ONE time I ended up using it, there was an error in their site and the payment never went through (words straight from my bank). I was never informed this happened and only knew after checking on it when noticing my rent was never withdrawn from my account many days after it was due. Got stuck with $65 in late fees. BUT WAIT.. THERES MORE! They charged me another $10 late fee........ the day after I paid it........... in what world does that makes sense? Anywhooooo, the lady from the office told me that I was stuck with all the late fees because it  ""worked for other residents"" and ""it's policy"".

The girls who work in the office are EXTREMELY immature. If you complain about anything, they will find reasons to issue lease violations, and give you the crappiest customer service possible. Once they've got you by the balls with your lease, that's when every single ounce of their accommodating attitudes go out the window.

While I understand that management unfortunately cannot control everything and I understand the challenges that comes with managing a property that is mostly college students, my main problem is with management. While I individually adore everyone down in the leasing office, as a team and as a company they are incompetent. There is no communication between staff members, your phone calls and emails often are not responded to, and on the weekends the staff closes the office whenever she wants to (since the manager isn't in) so she can go out and do whatever she likes. The building is only two years old but the elevators are constantly breaking down (I know this isn't their fault, but it is still inconvenient) and the upkeep of the building is terrible. There was dog poop and throw up in the hallways for several days before anyone came to clean it up. The security company they hire don't do anything but sit in the garage and smoke. There was a time period where my car kept getting vandalized and instead of filling out an incident report, they asked if I had any enemies and blew me off.

          As the year went on, things got better. However, maintenance here was consistently awful. One morning while cooking breakfast, a light fixture fell and hit me in the head. I called maintenance and put in a request, but nothing ever happened. The parking garage here is horrible. I mean awful. If you have a big vehicle, good luck. I have a truck and getting in and out of this garage was a nightmare. Overall, this place was just very poorly put together. 
           On this plus side, the applicances are very nice. The location in regards to west campus is not the best, about a 15-20 minute walk. Overall, my stay here was very unsatisfactory. I know the apartment was taken over by a new company so hopefully it will be much better. I hope my review helps those thinking about living here, if anyone has any questions, please feel free to contact me. I know the employees of Crest had nothing to do with a company so poorly run, so thank you to the employees for working so hard day in and day out.",2015-07-31,Harrison W.
12Fifty5 at University,https://www.yelp.com/biz/12fifty5-on-university-tempe?osq=12Fifty5+at+University,4.0,"General:
I am a student at ASU and have been staying here for about an year. I moved out from University Park (sucked big time) and came here. I find this place very peaceful, clean (no bedbugs or roaches unless you invite them).

Price:
I find the rent to be pretty moderate, comparable to other good apts.

Gym:
It  has a small but decent gym with fewer machines (I am a morning person, so I never had any problems getting hold of treadmill or elliptical).

Maintenance:
All my maintenance requests were taken care in time (max 2 days). No water problems, although in summers, I did have some problem with the AC not being able to cool the house but I guess that's the Arizona summer to blame for.

Internet: 
The only thing that sucks is the internet. They allow you to get *only* a centurylink connection which is very slow, no cox (I find it better).

Laundry:
People (students) are very unrespectful of others time, they put in the laundry and don't take it out for hours. This is very irritating.

Security:
It is a gated community and their is a security patrol at night. Still I keep my bike in the house's balcony instead of locking it out in the open at the bike stands

All in all I liked my stay here.  And it's a good place for *students* going to ASU.",2014-05-02,Tarun S.

The shower was fixed and they left with a blue stain on our bathroom counter and sewage water in our bathroom. 
Now our toilet is leaking.

In the year I have lived here I think this is the 11th maintenance issue we have had, not to mention the roaches infesting the place and such...
Basically we pay about $1,100/month for unsanitary, unlivable conditions and I plan to bring it up to them ASAP, this place is run like a halfway house, it's despicable. 


Third update...
They sent the dry wall guy in before the plumber...so after an hour of him working he concluded he couldn't fix it because there was still a leak...uh-noduh! 
So that night the plumber comes in at 8 pm until 9:30 pm...
Then today the dry wall guy came back and started working. My favorite part was when he took his dirty rags and left them on our couch. Supposedly the painters will come tomorrow. We shall see. It's been 1 1/2 weeks, send help ;)

I am moving out before my lease ends, and forfeiting the last two weeks because I just can't stand to live here anymore. Cockroaches are everywhere, whether you are extremely clean and tidy or your place is a pigsty. Our neighbors are extremely messy (which is an understatement) and my place is extremely well-kept, and both apartments have issues- in fact ever building has an issue here. So they bombed this past week, saying everything had to be pulled from cabinets and you had to vacate the apartment for at least 4 hours after treatment- well no note was ever left when I got home from work, but the chemicals made me sick to my stomach. 

All in the same week- my sink became clogged- the piping and buildings have been so mismanaged over the years, the build up from other people started to rear its ugly head into my apartment. I went to the office to report that I had an emergency because my sink was flooding, and they brushed it off. I repeated myself, saying that it was an emergency and needed maintenance ASAP- They came over quickly, but then said they needed to call a plumber- the plumber showed up hours later (8:30pm) and was there until 10:30pm at which said he didn't have all the tools he needed and he would be back- he never came back- so for the next 2 days- I waited to get this fixed. AND there is STILL 2 HUGE holes in the kitchen wall- great way to waste the electricity! I went to complain ask for some sort of reimbursement because I had no running water, couldn't cook for 3 nights and the holes are still there!

The rod in the shower was broken, it looked like they didn't even clean before we moved in, the bath was black, the fridge had old stains, the oven had stuff in the drawer still from the previous owners, its disgusting, no wonder there are so many bugs here.

Pros:
close to ASU.

Cons:
* Every year the rent increased by 50 dollars.
* Not enough bike racks. My bike got stolen there.
* Maintenance response is very slow.. takes up to 3 days sometimes.
* Their central air conditioning is very old and consumes a lot of energy (Electric bill in the summer goes up to $175 for a one bedroom, setting the thermostat to 78 degrees. In both summers I lived there the AC stopped cooling and the maintenance showed their incompetency by taking about a whole month and 4 work orders to fix the issue. In the beginning they tried to convince me that nothing was wrong. At the end I insisted they change the thermostat and it fixed the problem. I FIXED it for them, they had no desire in even trying to figure out what the problem was.
* Their infrastructure do not support Cable TV or Cable Internet. You're forced to get either Satellite TV/Internet or DSL Internet.
* They will rip you off when you move out by taking all your security deposit and sending you a bill for damages that are normal wear and tear. and they will charge you for cleaning the carpet and the apartment no matter what!!!!!!!! and will send you a letter saying if you don't pay the bill will go to a collection agency to ruin your credit!
* BEWARE OF COCKROACHES.. This place is infested with cockroaches like no one's business. In the summer they will attack your apartment. I keep my apartment clean and take the trash out all the time. I even have them spray it every week and couldn't stop them. They told me I should use a sink and a bathtub stoppers all the time. In fact, that helped but I'm a human and I forget sometimes to do that resulting in a massive cockroach attack. Their sewer system is infested with cockroaches. AVOID AT ALL COST!

I WILL NEVER ADVISE A FRIEND TO LIVE THERE. THEY'RE MUCH BETTER PLACES IN THE SAME PRICE RANGE. I MOVED TO A MUCH BETTER PLACE FOR THE SAME PRICE.. I WISH I DIDN'T EXTEND MY CONTRACT WITH THEM. FACT IS I WAS TOO LASY TO MOVE OUT BUT AFTER TWO YEARS I THOUGHT I HAD ENOUGH!!!",2013-02-25,Ab O.

BLVD63,https://www.yelp.com/biz/blvd63-apartments-san-diego,5.0,"This review is only as a visitor. I've been to this resort, yes resort, a number of times to visit my kid. Upon entry, I noticed the well-kept landscaping and the ""parent area"", complete with bbq stations to keep parents away from all the action. From what I saw, this is a non-stop live ""The Real Cancun"". I walked by the pool area as the kids were partying in the pool; it looked like the Palms in the summer.

The units are very spacious, furnished, and reminiscent of the Real World. Don't be surprised if you run into Puck. The complex is a great alternative to the expensive dorms on campus, and provides so much more room. I did not see any trash on the floor, nor did I get a whiff of that pukey smell associated with ""student housing"" apartments. The dorms took my life savings and this place is affordable for a student on a limited budget. A shuttle is available to and from campus, a shopping center is walking distance, restaurants line the street, so there is no need for a car.

My kid loves it because she pays less than her old apartment, there is a convenient shuttle to and from SDSU, and there is a great gym on site. I've seen the gym and it beats most chains for amenities and cleanliness.

If could move in, I would in a heartbeat and be that creepy junkie from Spring Breakers, without the good looks and grill.",2016-12-30,Paco C.
BLVD63,https://www.yelp.com/biz/blvd63-apartments-san-diego,5.0,"At the end of the day, BLVD is the best student apartment that you're going to find in the SDSU college area.

I'm going to get the cons out of the way right now: For about month, there was a huge issue with connecting to the internet at night. After that got fixed, fire alarms would set off once every other week because people were pulling the fire extinguishers off the wall and spraying them, causing the fire alarms in the ENTIRE building to be set off until someone from maintenance came to enter in a code to shut it off. Even though that doesn't happen anymore, whenever my smoke detector makes a tick noise, I automatically put my hands over my ears in fear that the noise will start again.

Pros: The complex is very well kept. The grounds and staircases are cleaned pretty much every morning, and service requests are completed within 24 hours whenever something breaks or clogs in my apartment. I live in a double, and going from paying $1450 a month to live in a cramped double in the dorms and a communal style bathroom to paying $650 a month to live in an extremely large double with its own hallway and two sinks in the bathroom was definitely an upgrade. Gym membership is included and the gym is open 24/7 and is right next to my apartment. The apartment has two very beautiful pools and a large spa area with bbq stations and bonfire pits located around, as well as hammocks. It's located right between a vons, CVS, and smart & final on one side, and Cheba Hut, Dirty Birds, and Tokyo Sushi Loha on the other. Couldn't ask for better food places, to be honest. The apartment has individual study rooms with white board walls and you can rent out white board markers or bring your own, which really help me to get homework done because I procrastinate when I'm in my own apartment. Rent can be paid online with direct deposit (no extra fee) or card (convenience fee charged by whoever processes payments).

Tip: I luckily have lived in corner units every year that I lived here, so I had no apartments on either side of me, which means I never had to experience noise issues. If people were being loud outside, I just shut my windows and couldn't hear anything. I recommend getting a corner unit if you don't like hearing people's drunk conversations at 1 am around you. Also, if you ever have any issues, go down to the resident service desk and explain the situation to them so that you can prevent issues happening in the future. I used to think that my freezer kept breaking and I kept having maintenance fix the ice machine, but after talking to them I realized it was because I was blocking the vent in my freezer. Kristian in particular has helped me through getting parking set up, setting up online payments, and reserving study rooms. The staff is there to help and actually want you to have a good time living here.",2016-11-28,Ryan G.
BLVD63,https://www.yelp.com/biz/blvd63-apartments-san-diego,5.0,"I moved into BLVD63 in August, the leasing process was very simple and straight forward and the staff at BLVD did a wonderful showing us around and presenting us with the available units. We opted for a 2 double room unit and paid the extra to get the extended balcony (if you have this option don't turn it down the balcony is literally 2x the size of all the others). On move in day they had all sorts of coupons,deals and friendly faces helping you find your unit and moving in. Our unit as well as all the others came completely furnished as well as loaded with appliances. Everything included was in perfect working order and the staff quickly helped out for anything that wasn't. ( our washer was iffy for about a day before we reported it and they sent maintenance to fix it.) 

The location of BLVD for me is ideal, it is down the street from State but isn't completely surrounded by college activity so you can get some of your work done. It has a plethora of food places within walking distance as well as gas stations,banks,grocery stores, pharmacies and barber within a 2 block radius. 
 BLVD facilities themselves are TOP NOTCH, they have 2 pools, one smaller volleyball pool which is perfect for relaxing and having quiet time, and then the main pool. The Main pool is a large resort style pool equip with hammocks, cabanas, lounge chairs and day beds. This place is popping when the sun is out on weekends. The security enforces a strict no glass rule to keep the pool area safe, but if you want to play games down by the pool you are more than welcome (pong,die,flip cup). Along with the main area, there is a large patio with multiple BBQ's located in the same area so you can grill up by the pool (a very overlooked convenience, have met a lot of friends from just grilling and chatting). If BBQ's and crazy pool parties aren't your thing, there is also a very large Jacuzzi that is always heated, the pool area is open till 10pm so if you finish studying/dinner/work and want to hop in the jacuzzi you are chillin. 
 Besides the pool area's the complex has a wonderful gym with brand new equipment. Everything from free weights to leg presses to even a yoga room, also there is a tanning facility to stay nice and bronze even in the winter. 
 Next up is the clubhouse, located next to the main pool area. This clubhouse is always air conditioned, and is home to multiple tv's, a larger movie theater type area (great for sports or rehearsing presentation as there are HDMI plug in's), also it has fooseball, 2 billiards tables, a shuffleboard and a pingpong table. On the second floor of the clubhouse is a great study area and study rooms that you can go to for a private homework session if you need to escape your noisy roommates. Furthermore there is a business center for anyone who needs to use a computer or a printer for an assignment, they have both PC and Macs in there so whatever operating system you like can be catered to.
 
The rent paying process can be done via their website or in person at the resident services office. I pay via a credit card (they don't take AMEX) and they take direct bank transfer or check. Rent is due the first of every month and they give you a 5 day grace period. 

What I found really separates this facility apart from anywhere else is the class and service of the employees here. The staff work very hard to make sure and problem you have is catered too and corrected as quickly as possible. We have had a couple hiccups that were tended to immediately. Kristian down in the resident services office has helped us out multiple times. From forgetting to pay rent, to dealing with us being angry when we forgot to buy parking passes and got our cars towed, she has kept us in high spirits about BLVD as well as solving and going above and beyond to solve our issues. She is also very diligent with informing us about upcoming events as well as letting us know right when we have a package delivered. Going into the resident service office and being welcomed by her contagious smile always assures you that any issue you have will be resolved as soon as possible. 

CONS: 

THIS IS A COLLEGE STUDENT COMPLEX, meaning there is a lot of debauchery that takes place here, especially on weekends with visitors coming stay. 

People here have some weird obsession to smacking the exit signs off the ceiling of the hallways, and it is not uncommon to find a whole corridor with every exit sign dangling after a long weekend. There is a really nice guy who spends the next day replacing all of them but it is comical sight to see. 

 The floors/walls are semi thin, if our upstairs neighbors turn on their subwoofer surround sound,I can lie in bed and hear every explosion going on as they watch transformers. Easily solved by simply asking them to turn it down.

THE FIRE ALARM - I don't know what company creates and installs these but they need an award, this is by far the loudest most painful alarm I have ever experienced in my life.",2016-11-09,Chase J.
BLVD63,https://www.yelp.com/biz/blvd63-apartments-san-diego,2.0,"I lived in the apartments the first year it opened.  I really only agreed to stay here because we were desperate to find a place and the furniture have never been used before us.  Physically, it was decent, because everything is brand new, but the experience was not worth the price of the rent. I made a list of what I experienced during my stay, along with other notes that you should be aware of (note that pricing I mention were when I lived there; prices and other fees may have changed):

1. Unlike other places I've lived in, parking spots here ARE NOT complimentary.  You have to pay a ridiculous amount monthly ($50 a month), which is something to think about when you also have to pay $150-300 per semester for campus parking itself.  If you choose to park in the surrounding area, you get your tires slashed.  There's also only like 20 visitor parking spaces in the entire garage so they fill up fast and you have to be lucky. Or get home by 3 pm to get a spot (maybe). 

2. Management was not helpful.  We had some trouble signing our lease in the beginning because roommates were going to go out of the country, etc., and I was told we (roommates and I) were going to be contacted about it.  They never did.  I went back eventually and learned that it was past our move in date already and we still did not have the proper documents yet because they never told us about them.  We warned them ahead of time that half of us would be out of the country by a certain date, yet they failed to inform us of everything that we needed to get done.  

3. Found out that the leasing office got my email wrong.  I told them the correction, still never got an email afterwards.  They never bothered to correct my email in the system no matter how many times I went.  So I never received any emails from them. 

4. Fire alarms went off frequently in the middle of the night. Latest when I was there was 2 am.

5. Had a couple instances where I never received a notice that I had packages delivered.  What happened was that they never even recorded it on their ipads to begin with, so they skipped me when writing notices.   

6. We paid an extra $60 to be on the top floor so that we wouldn't get as much noise as if we had people living above us.  It didn't do anything about the noise.  People would be running across the hallways and they still sound like elephants that we still have trouble sleeping at night.  

7. You have to pay extra ($60) to either be on the top (4th) floor, or to be near (or facing) the pool.  If you want both then it adds up together to $120.

8.  Apparently people are still immature that they play ding dong ditch literally every weekend.  I know how to use the word literally.  Literally.  Every weekend. 

9. There have been parties going on in multiple parts of the building, and were quite loud, and yet the security decides to knock on my door, when I only had 6 guests, and told us to keep it down.  

10. I don't know if the shuttle service is really under them, but I once saw a BLVD shuttle bus driver run/bump into a biker.  Also, piece of advice for the shuttle: leave at least half an hour before you want to get on campus. If you miss it it's another 15-30 minute wait.

11. It's $50 to replace your key card.  Don't lose your key card. 

12. Our dishwasher broke down multiple times, so we had to keep asking for the maintenance guy.  (Their maintenance service was great though)

13. This didn't happen to me but I had friends living on the second floor and they still got ants within a week of moving in.  You have to make sure that your food isn't out in the open for a long time.  

14. DOUBLE CHECK YOUR DEPOSIT WHEN YOU GET IT BACK.  They charged us $100 for a paint job that they didn't even do for us after we moved out.  We had to tell them about it before they realized that they shouldn't have charged us for it, and then gave us more of our deposit back. 

The place looks nice because it's brand new, but once it wears down, don't bother.  I'm glad I graduated so that I wouldn't have to go through the trouble of looking for another apartment, because I wouldn't want to come back here.",2015-10-06,Jenny T.
BLVD63,https://www.yelp.com/biz/blvd63-apartments-san-diego,1.0,"Just beware, this place is the typical San Diego college rental that tries to take care of the unsuspecting tenant and keep their deposits!

VERY rude and non responsive to tenants requests.  Sent emails for 5 days leading up to Move-out only to be ignored about the procedure and specifics about parking passes and security deposit return.  I am a guarantor of my daughters apartment and I would of liked this info before she had to leave.  Talked to them today, ONE day after move-out and they said there were ""too busy"" to get to anyone's questions.    As a profession I go after landlords for failure to abide to the rental law on specific events such as move out and to be ignored shows you how unprofessional they are and ignorant of the laws.

So, Christian today informed me that everyone's carpet gets cleaned and charged against the security deposit as ""they have to have it sanitized for the next renter"".  WRONG.   They do have it have it clean and ready for the next tenant, but IT IS NOT deductible from the security deposit if it's normal wear and tear.  Once I called her out on her statement, she put me on hold for over 8 minutes only to go and talk to her manager.  Then I got transferred to the Manager who told me that they were ""too busy"" to itemize and take photos of everyone's unit that just moved out to prove the damage and that she has over 250 units to manage!  Oh well, that $2800 rent x 250 so they should have plenty of money to pay the proper staff to do their job.

Just warning everyone that just moved out. If you think you got shorted on your deposit, message me.  I can send you the info on the laws and what you might be able to do.   I already told them if it's not by the book for my daughters apartment, I will see them in court!",2016-08-01,Robin G.

I also love the staff here. Gabby is always there to help me out whenever I have any questions or service requests.
 There's also a ton of places you can meet new people. There's two pools and a gym that's open 24/7.

BLVD63,https://www.yelp.com/biz/blvd63-apartments-san-diego,3.0,"I've moved into Blvd63 in June. Blvd63 is a beautiful apt complex and affordable if you are living with roommates. The amenities are great. The only issue I have is that the Internet or the free wifi they have here never works. You will be lucky to have it working for a full day. It can be really annoying when you're doing important work online and the Internet goes out for majority of the day sometimes even multiple days in a row. Ever since I moved here in June the best record I have of the wifi working is two days max. It really sucks because this is such a nice community yet the most important amenity, especially for a college student, is horrible.

Another thing, I asked BLVD63 if pets are allowed and they respectfully told me only service animals. Um, I've only seen 2 dogs with service vest on and the rest here are puppies. I even asked one of the residents here what service does your dog provide and she said ""he's not a service dog, I just really wanted a puppy"" really?? I just think BLVD63 should allow at least one pet per unit to make things easier, or really look into the people who have ""service dogs"" here.

Also, since this is typically off campus housing, you're more than likely to have a roommate when living here. It's nice and affordable, I just wish it's not one lease that we all share. An individual lease would be much appreciated.

The gym is a pretty nice size, most of it is cardio and free weights, just wish they had more options with the leg machines. Literally only 2 leg machines. Leg curler and a calf machine. I understand this is not a legit gym, but not all of us who work out are cardio bunnies or obsessed with our arms. Legs matter too.

Get more friendly security guards too, there's this one guy in particular who never smiles and it's creepy. He roams around here looking like slender man. Smile dude, jeez.

Anyways, I want to give 3.5 stars, but yelp doesn't have this option, so 3 it is. Half star for the gym, one star for the wifi. BLVD63 is a very nice community it's just the gym could take out a few cardio machines and replace them with leg machines and the wifi situation is very annoying. I had to re-do so many things because of this shit wifi. I basically give myself brain hemorrhages from being so pissed off all the time lol Beautiful community, just get some decent wifi!",2016-07-21,Blayne D.
BLVD63,https://www.yelp.com/biz/blvd63-apartments-san-diego,3.0,"I lived here for a year and waited until I moved out to write this review. In addition to a lot of complaining, I'm going to warn readers that are considering moving here, as I know it's a popular spot for SDSU students and some people will sign that lease with their friends regardless of what they read here. In summary, you get what you pay for at this complex (nice amenities, beautiful place) but all the while this complex is persistent in sucking naive college students dry ($), quite aware that many are first time leasers, vulnerable, and ignorant.

CONS:
My first experience with BLVD63 was... not good. I was coerced into choosing a certain apartment unit by being told a false price. Upon discovering a rise of a few hundred dollars in my monthly rent and voicing my concerns, I was treated by the staff in an extremely rude, dismissive way that created tension between myself and the staff for my entire stay. However, it was too late at that point and I was hooked into a year long lease with BLVD. The manager was kind enough to work things out with me, but essentially all that was offered was a ""sorry about that"". So watch out for these kinds of things.

In addition to this, there are many, many accounts of residents here that had difficulty getting their security deposits back. I had no problem because my place was left in pristine condition (except for a fee to replace the shutters on the patio door, which by design WILL BREAK. Literally guys, I saw other tenant's door shutters and they were all broken. Out with those shutters please BLVD!).

Often times staff seemed insufficient or incompetent, although friendly most of the time! 3 times in a row, the funds from my rent checks were distributed to the wrong apartment unit though I'd specifically written the right unit on the check. And I got late fees for this! You'd think they'd learn... So be sure to communicate with staff when needed.

THIS COMPLEX IS FOR PARTY PEOPLE. EXPECT NOISE. If this isn't your thing and you don't like seeing puke in the elevator every weekend or staying up late listening to (your neighbor's) bangers, maybe you shouldn't move here.

Fire alarms. A lot of them. I think I've endured ear damage from the cumulative trauma of SO MANY FIRE ALARMS. I'm considering suing to repair the damage (jk). Bring ear plugs on move in.


PROS
The place is beautiful, its got a gym, printer, computers, free coffee in the morning, security guards, shuttles to school, and TWO pools! The apartments are very nice and in my experience the furniture held up and seemed to be of good quality. The insulation in my unit was awful and it was freezing during the winter, but in other units it was fine. I've never lived around so many young people than when I lived here, and that's a positive attribute for many when choosing a college home. There are gardeners keeping the estate looking good all week long.

So in short, if you have money, sure go ahead and live here. And watch out, BLVD will be out to get as much of it as possible...",2016-08-30,Chantalle B.
BLVD63,https://www.yelp.com/biz/blvd63-apartments-san-diego,1.0,"**My main reason for writing this review is at the bottom half** Although this place has nice amenities, it is pricey for us struggling college students. Don't get me wrong, it's a nice place compared to most, but there are some things that are worrisome and questionable. $50 a month for parking? That's more than what SDSU charges. Half-assed security guards walking around doing nothing to help when it is needed. People constantly vandalizing the property and nothing being done about it. Sketchy people who are obviously not residents coming into the complex. Bikes constantly being stolen/vandalized. One of my roommates had to replace three bikes because they were either stolen or vandalized. Resident's car tires being slashed, including one of my roommate's. People constantly playing loud music and making unnecessary noise at ridiculous hours (security would do nothing about it). Shuttles lags it sometimes, but it really isn't a problem if you time it right.

THE REAL REASON FOR WRITING THIS REVIEW. 
Make sure you double check your security deposit statement when or if you decide to move out. I am not exaggerating when I say this. Management decided it was necessary to replace a whole carpet over ONE stain. They showed us a picture of the stain. Trust me when I say that it is not a reason to replace a WHOLE carpet. As a result, we were charged $951 off our security deposit, which was $900. On top of that, they also charged $220 for cleaning the unit even though we left it nearly spotless. So, including our security deposit, we were left with a $271 balance to pay. So far, they have done nothing to clearly explain why this was done and they most likely will not. I'm sure we will have to pay it in the end. BE WARNED! THEY WILL CHARGE YOU FOR ANY LITTLE DETAIL. 

On another note, I know another resident who is also going through something similar. They are being charged because of damage to the bathroom tile? Which is funny because I'm pretty sure whatever BLVD has as a bathroom floor isn't tile and most likely very difficult to knowingly damage it. Living there two years did nothing to ours. They are trying to dispute their charges too.",2016-08-25,Carlos C.

The staff is very organized so I've never had a problem with any service requests not getting done on time or anything that people who live in other apartments have to deal with. 
The most important thing for me is the actual apartment unit I have to live in. Which is why I'm so happy I moved into BLVD. The rooms are huuuge for the doubles. There's so much space, and the bathrooms are big too. I like how the apartments come fully furnished, and the couches are comfortable to crash on or just relax. For the beds, I'd recommend getting a mattress topper just to make them a little softer, but everything else is perfect. I lived in a corner unit this year so my apartment always had plenty of sunshine and a nice breeze. It really felt like I was living in a hotel.
The staff does a great job of keeping the apartment complex clean and beautiful. Gabby at the Resident Service desk is also a great help, whenever I have anything wrong I know I can just email her and she'll take care of it for me. That's one of the best things about this place, you know who to go to to get any issues solved. If the staff you're talking to doesn't know how to fix a problem, they'll find someone who does.
The clubhouse is also another favorite of mine at BLVD. There's like 6 tvs and huge couches everywhere, and they also have a separate room just for this one big tv and more couches and benches.

Mostly everyone here is sophomores/juniors/seniors at SDSU, so it's really easy to socialize and make new friends, especially with all the events that they throw for their residents! The staff is very informational and organized. When I had trouble with anything, Gabby would always be there to explain everything and get it all squared away, which is something I can't be grateful enough for because I never had to go searching for someone to fix something for me.
The best part about living here is the amount of amenities that we have access to and how huuuuge the rooms are. The apartment comes with the standard furniture, but there's still plenty of room to personalize and make it our own. The bathrooms have two sinks (if you have a double) and the beds are full sized. It's a huge upgrade from the dorms, and it costs less too. There's also a big gym, two pools, and a clubhouse with a lot of individual study rooms if you ever want to have study groups. I really liked the study rooms because the wall is a giant white board that you can do homework problems on.
My one tip after living here for such a long time is that if you have a service request, either call the office or go down and put it in. It's a lot faster that way than if you submit it online, because they print it right away at the desk and it'll get into the maintenance workers' hands faster that way.

No, this isn't going to be the cheapest place you find, but for the price and what is included it's worth it.

I've had security knock on my door multiple times without cause. I don't know what BLVD's definition of a noise complaint is, but clearly it's a bored security guard's, with nothing better to do with their time, ability to hear music from outside a door. I've had them knock on my door at 8:45 on a saturday night complaining that my music was too loud, noting that there were no guests at the apartment (Didn't know I was paying what I am paying to continue living in the dorms again). However, as I am sitting here studying for a midterm on a sunday night/Monday morning at 2:02 a.m. there isn't a security phone number in sight to call about an ACTUAL noise complaint about the pounding music on the floor above me. This is absolutely ridiculous and find it completely mind boggling that security can be so overbearing at unnecessary times, but completely useless at times of need. This is a serious problem, and if this is BLVD's idea of being useful and efficient, then they are a long way off.

BLVD63,https://www.yelp.com/biz/blvd63-apartments-san-diego,5.0,"I have been living here for a little over a month now and I could not be happier. The leasing agents, clubhouse employees, and maintenance staff are wonderful. They all genuinely care about your experience here as a resident and want you to enjoy yourself as much as possible. They answer any questions I have and really go out of their way to make sure I am having the best experience possible. 

Maintenance is wonderful. They always come the day of or at least the next day of when I request service. Their friendliness, quick service, and quality of service is impeccable. 

The amenities here are great and the people are really friendly. I love the pool, and if the main one is crowded, the smaller one is always available as well. The clubhouse is always clean, air conditioned, and fun. The shuttle service is really convenient for sdsu students. They always have some type of fun activity like trivia night or waffle wednesday to keep the residents occupied and its a great way to meet your fellow neighbors. There's free food almost every week which is a plus as well. 

The location is awesome. Two grocery stores, rite aid, cvs, two banks, car wash, nail salons, food, gas stations all either walking distance or a super quick drive away. I loved not having to worry about moving big pieces of furniture since its furnished for you, and the fact that internet and cable/HBO is included is so convenient and saves a lot of money. 

The rooms are spacious and the bathrooms are clean and spacious as well. I know it has only been a month, but I really believe Blvd63 will keep up with this great service for years to come. 

Even if some disrespectful neighbors get too loud, there is a number to call to report it and security is pretty on top of things. Although the only complaint I have is that their security staff is not the nicest, most mature, or helpful staff. But luckily we don't have to deal with them often. 

All in all I am a happy resident and I can't wait to see what the rest of the year has in store! I definitely recommend this apartment to anyone! Its worth every penny and more! When you consider everything that is included and what is offered for the price, you can't go wrong. 

The fact that management takes the time to look at each of these reviews and comment on them about how they would like to meet with you and make your experience better or thank you for the review is great serve in itself. Not every apartment even bothers with looking at these. They really do care about the quality of living here and it is appreciated.

the apartment smells and feels so new, which is such a nice feeling! of course there are minor issues with it here and there, but that's to be expected when you're the first person to ever live here!

as for the staff, my first day here, i ran into some unexpected issues with the apartment that pertained some of my health problems - the biggest being that my family needs to have an extra key in case something should happen to me medically. the staff was great in having me fill out a form, and that night i received a call from amber stating that i has been approved, pending just a little more paperwork. overall, it was a nice and easy experience.

i feel so bad for the people that are unhappy on here. so far, i have met most of my neighbours, all of whom are incredibly respectful and nice. if anyone is out on their balcony in my building, they always say hi to one another. it's a very nice and welcoming environment.

BLVD63,https://www.yelp.com/biz/blvd63-apartments-san-diego,1.0,"So when I moved into blvd63 I was really excited because they are brand new apartments. When we first moved in we had issues with the cable, so we put in a service request but nothing was ever done about it. We had to call the cable company several times and yell at them just to get someone to come out and fix the issue. We were without the cable we were promised for the first month we were here. 

I was VERY disappointed with the quality of the apartments. They were still finishing up the apartments when people started to move in. They really rushed to complete them because there are so many issues. One of my outlets in my room worked fine but one of the plug-ins just stopped working and hasn't been fixed. Our refrigerator seems to not keep our food cold enough so it spoils quicker than normal. We made a service request because we literally could not open the door in front of our dryer. We couldn't use our dryer. Nothing was ever done about that either so we had a friend fix it. I logged into my account and it says on all of our service requests that the work was completed! Ummm...no you guys didn't fix any of these problems. On my door frame of my closet it was put in crooked. There are a few paint mistakes around the apartment also. The color they tried to put on top is a different shade than the one underneath. Charging $600 per month for rent, you should at least fix the shit in the apartments people are paying to live in. 

The people living in the apartments trash the elevators. Several times I've came home and there's alcohol spilled on the floor, throw up, cigarettes, trash, and food just left there. People also leave trash all over the parking structure but I guess since it has no trash cans anywhere in the structure people have nowhere to throw their trash. They actually pay for someone to pick up this trash! 

I thought the gym was going to be so convenient. It's NOT air conditioned which doesn't make sense because people are working out. I seriously see international students in there all the time working out with sandals. That is sooo disgusting and unsanitary. No one wants to see your talens. Don't you realize it's a safety hazard?! Also a lot of people in there smell like B.O. I can't even work out sometimes because they smell so bad. It's really annoying when guys try to lift a lot of weight. They struggle so much that when they're done they drop the weights on the floor so hard that I feel like they're gonna break the equipment and the floor. Not to mention how loud and annoying the sound is every single time. 

What really upsets me is that if you want to park in the parking structure you have to pay $50 a month. That's more than a parking permit for SDSU. So ridiculous!!!! Even though they say not to park on the street, people do it anyway so they don't even pay for parking. Why am I paying $50 per month when they don't even check the parking structure. I see people who aren't handicapped parking their cars in handicapped parking. Thinking they're hot shit. They don't even have a handicapped permit, let alone a permit to even park in the parking structure. They say you'll get towed for parking without a permit but I see people doing it all the time. I'm very unhappy about that.

Also they say that pets are not allowed. Lately I've been seeing this international student walking a little white puppy. If pets are not allowed why do I keep seeing this dog? I love dogs but if he is allowed to have one at his apartment than I will too.",2014-11-23,Jamie B.

The property policy is that you can't hang anything on your balcony whether it be a flag, a pair of shorts or a towel.  I can't believe that the students are making a political statement out of it.  Also the loudest voice was a man from TX.  Doesn't TX think the flag only has one star on it and if I recall my history (and believe you me I do) didn't TX want to separate from the USA and become it's own state?  So why all the patriotism from such a person I have no idea.  If you want to hang your flag, whatever country you are from, hang it in your apartment or your window.  You should all have read the lease when you moved in and you should all abide by the rules, NOTHING CAN BE HANGING OR DRAPED OVER YOUR BALCONY.  I would think as students these residents would be able to read and respect the community rules.  They were put in place for a reason.  Keep your politics in your own space.

West Village UC Davis,https://www.yelp.com/biz/west-village-davis?osq=west+village+at+uc,2.0,"Do you like waking up at 8am almost every day to the sound of leaf blowers outside your window? All autumn, there have been leaf blowers right outside my window blasting with incredible volume. This means that we wake up to leaf blowers.  We try to meditate with leaf blowers.  We try to study before class with leaf blowers.  We have our coffee and breakfast with leaf blowers.  You get the picture.   The West Village community relations staff could schedule leaf blowers to start work during the afternoons when everyone is awake and away at school, but no, they schedule them to begin at 8am sharp, when we are all here and forced to listen.  
  
This is a quality of life issue that would be very easy to fix:
- Schedule leaf blowing when most people are away.

West Village UC Davis,https://www.yelp.com/biz/west-village-davis?osq=west+village+at+uc,1.0,"Even though this is maybe one of the nicest places to live in Davis, it's also the worst. 
Management is hard to work with, hard to communicate with. After so long of dealing with them my calls ended up getting screened so I would block my caller ID just to get through. We had an ongoing issue with a roommate last year (almost 6 months, we reported her after 2 months) and it took management 4 months to BARELY resolve the issue. They ended up paying us because she had taken some of our belongings. 
Rent goes up even though we're already paying a ridiculous amount. The leases are bogus and Rambles is greedy. My roommate is in a smaller room than I'm in and she's paying more than I am because ""I've lived here longer"" which is BS. We've been in the same apartment together the SAME amount of time. They also waste money by giving out free food and t shirts and a bunch of gift cards. Personally, I'd rather NOT pay $1,000+ a month to cover someone else's meal and other handouts. 
The fridge is too small for 4 people, I couldn't imagine doubling up and having 6 people in an apartment. 
They're supposed to clean your apartment before you move in but that's horse crap. Both apartments I've moved into were FILTHY before I moved in.
Recently we've had random service workers enter our apartment WITHOUT notice which is a violation of California law. 
There are no cameras in the parking lot so if your car gets hit or vandalized, tough luck. Even though it's on THEIR property.
This wifi is terrible. For someone who has a low data cell phone plan (because let's be honest, what else can I afford after living here?) I'm ALWAYS on wifi. It was down for like 2 or 3 weeks before anyone at Rambles could figure it out. They sent out emails claiming that it wasn't their fault. Pretty unprofessional and no compensation.

BEWARE:  The rent is not what you think.  I live in Solstice and just found out that the last month is not pro-rated.  They charge installments and, yes its in the lease that they charge full rent for the last month, but you have to move out halfway through the month if you don't resign the lease.  So the monthly price is actually even more than what they are overcharging for anyway.  I was paying $930/month of Solstice.  It is actually $968.75 per month since they don't pro-rate the last month.  So shady that this is going to ruin my time and memories here.  None of this is mentioned when they get you to sign on the dotted line.

West Village UC Davis,https://www.yelp.com/biz/west-village-davis?osq=west+village+at+uc,1.0,"I genuinely apologize to the leasing agent who requested I submit an updated review of West Village - because this will not be a forgiving one.

I lived in West Village for a full year with no problems. After summer concluded, I took over someone's lease for the fall months (this is were trouble started). 

1) My unit (4 bed/bath) was for a room in Solstice. For no clear reason except for that the unit was ""no longer available"" we were moved to the Rambles.

2) My unit wanted to move in on September 1st (we needed to for work/etc. engagements) which was fine when we were scheduled to move into Solstice. However Rambles moves in on the 14th, so we had to scramble for weeks back and forth with management just to move in on time.

3) I had turned in my paperwork and was told I needed to finalize a signature. I came in three times over a three month period and was told the leasing agent I started my paper work with ""doesn't work Fridays."" Ok. At the time, due to my work schedule, Friday was my only availability, so I vocalized this and announced that I would not be able to come in on ANY OTHER DAY. The front desk insisted that because my leasing agent has a literal physical lock on her paperwork, no one else can access it. I questioned this because it just seems ridiculous that only one agent can access a person's information. They said it was not possible and told me it didn't matter and that I could show up the week I move in because that final signature was not something that needed to be rushed.

4) I email and call the leasing agent I started my paperwork with over the summer repeatedly - no response, no returned calls. I was not given the option to leave a voicemail or message for the particular leasing agent.

5) I show up to moving day and am apparently ""not in the system."" The leasing agent I was originally assigned to, never opened or processed the sensitive paperwork and materials that I had emailed her (at her request). She had my social security, my personal information, income information sitting in her inbox unopened. I found that unbelievable. I had to return a second time just to move in. I had to repeatedly return with various pieces of paperwork because, since I was not in the system, I did not receive the emails asking for the specific move-in requirements. Requirements include a money order or a cashier's check. It's a hassle, while not a deal-breaker, yet at this point infuriating on top of everything else.

6) Upon move-in, my key does not lock my room. Our heater broke and instead of being fixed, we were given three space heaters which we weren't allowed to plug in all at once because it would ""short circuit"" our apartment and reduce us to a black out. Our dryer then broke.

7) To make up for the fact that our apartment was switched from Solstice to Rambles, we were told that we were put in the Ramble's model apartment. In other words, the unit had never been lived in. After living here for a few months, we have received tons of mail in the name of people who had lived in this unit. We have also found marks, chips and signs of use on the walls and furniture. It's not unsightly - but it is proof that we are not the first inhabitants and that the truth was stretched and will probably be reflected in an unjust charge to our security deposit.

8) DEAL BREAKER: I received an email announcing that I owed a large balance and that I had not paid enough upon moving in. I keep emailing and calling in to dispute the charge, as the late fee date was looming closer. No one picked up the phone for two weeks because of internet outage. Ok.

In the office I am told that I was being charged too much for rent. I was being charged for a parking permit they had not given me. I was being charged for a security deposit I had already paid. They had SPLIT my ledger - instead of reflecting that my original leaser had paid our security deposit, it had separated the costs and been put on me to be paid a second time. 

The leasing agent asks his boss for advice regarding reimbursement...IN FRONT OF ME she acknowledges his question by loudly saying ""I have to pee,"" before answering. In front of me. What unprofessional HORSE CRAP this was I don't even know.

I left the office just to receive an email reiterating the original charge and threatening a late fee. I reply with the information of my meeting. No reply, and a late fee charged. A week later, I come back to the office. There, two agents admit that they had bad communication, were disorganized and one had been moving, therefore unable to review/share documents to the office. Ended up THEY OWED ME MONEY. I'm still waiting to be paid back.


I comprehend understaffing. But this is incompetence. The rent is very high compared to neighboring apartments, yet they cannot hire enough staff or create an organized system.

A living arrangement should not be a second job. This was an additional stressor and a drain on the brief 3-month period I tried to re-lease.",2016-11-14,B M.
West Village UC Davis,https://www.yelp.com/biz/west-village-davis?osq=west+village+at+uc,1.0,"Very shady with your rent and money in general. 
Your lease will say August to September or September to August depending on where you live,
however, you cannot move in until half way through the month. So technically you only have the place for 11.5 months but pay for the full 12 months. You either can move in on September 15th or have to move out on August 15th. This is extreme inconvenient because you're not going to have a place to live nor store your stuff for two weeks because pretty much every other place in Davis let you move in on the 1st day of the month. 

I moved out on August 31th and did not get my security deposit back until November 2nd (A violation of the lease which promise 21 days after the lease expiration data) 
They will charge you $50 automatically for carpet cleaning regardless of the condition (I can assure that everyone who moved out of West Village was charged with this fee, another violation of the lease which promised ""charges in excess of normal wear only"")
In addition to a $35 - $50 cleaning charge. All of these charges will incur after you moved out so you have absolutely no say in the matter.

They could never get it right. Why are they still using this ""service provider"". When all they provide is headaches?

They accept mediocrity, as if it's ok. We are already paying for overpriced rooms with severely worn out furnishings as it is. The very least one could do is provide at least some type of consistent internet service.

But even that, they still can't get it right, even after more than FIVE WHOLE YEARS.

Unbelievable. Since then, Carmel was either merged or taken over by Greystar, but we still get mediocre Korcett, and yet they are completely ok with their performance. Any other reasonable and respectable company would have done away with Korcett ages ago.

The staff threatened to turn my lease over to debt collectors, so I had to pay an additional 6 months of lease without ever finding anyone who qualified to take over my place.

West Village UC Davis,https://www.yelp.com/biz/west-village-davis?osq=west+village+at+uc,1.0,"My son and 2 of his friends lived in Solstice in a 3 bedroom 3 bathroom unit from August 28 2015 to August 15 2016.  The facilities are nice and brand new but very expensive ($970 a month).  
When we signed the lease and gave our deposit of $150.00, they should have just told us that we will never see that deposit money again no matter how clean the unit was when the boys moved out.  I happen to know that the boys and their moms helped clean the apartment.  I was the last person to leave the place and I can attest to that fact.
We received a letter several weeks later that stated that not only are we NOT getting a deposit back, they're charging us an additional $38.00.  Here's the breakdown:

Carpet cleaning                      55.00
Cleaning bedroom/common 60.00
Paint common area               73.00

                                                  38.00

If West Village chooses to get everything professionally cleaned between tenants, they should incorporate that in the rent and not give people a surprise bill after they've already vacated the premises. That's shady business practice.  As a landlord myself in Berkeley  CA, as long as my tenant leaves the house in the same condition as when they moved in, they are entitled to all their deposit back.  If I choose to get a cleaner and painter after they move out, that cost is on me.

My advice to anyone considering this place, make this your very last resort.  You're better off sharing a house with a bunch of friends.  If you absolutely have to stay here:

1) Take lots of pictures and make copious notes before you move in on every ding on the walls, stains on the carpet or anything that they can blame you for after you move out (just like when you're renting a car).  Keep a copy for yourself and make a copy for West Village to file away with your lease agreement.  

2) Schedule a walk through with a West Village Rep and get signed off that everything is indeed clean before turning in your keys.

If this place didn't have such shady business practices as stated by many reviewers on yelp, maybe they would actually get referrals from their tenants and they wouldn't be desperate enough to cheat college kids of $150.00.",2016-10-06,Monique T.

I asked them to fix my windows back in September and the maintenance man came in, forced it closed and told me not to open it. Like what? Super unhelpful.

The gym is very nice compared to other gyms in Davis but crowded too. There are a lot of bus stops here which is cool.

West Village UC Davis,https://www.yelp.com/biz/west-village-davis?osq=west+village+at+uc,1.0,"My suggestion - IF YOU THINK THAT MONEY IS NOT A PROBLEM FOR YOU, THIS PLACE WOULD BE GREAT. OTHERWISE, THINK HARD AND THINK AGAIN.

The only plus point of this apartment is the amenities that they are offering (it has a bus line directly to and from the campus, and etc etc etc.). For an apartment at Davis, it is overpriced, their internet connection is unreliable at times, they have really bad personnel and the one that makes me really hate this place is their policies regarding another person taking over our lease (i.e.- the security deposit would be handed to that person instead of us [as they're taking over our place whatsoever]).
(note; this last point is only if the person is taking over the whole lease but if someone is just subleasing from you, that should be fine, but they have said that in the rental agreement that you must not let anyone stay over in your apartment other than yourself so it really sucks).

Moreover, parking here is handled by UCD TAPS and one of my friends had received a ticket here while having a legitimate parking permit which they said as ""not visible"".

Last but not the least, despite the high prices that they charge you, they also require you to pay the FULL amount for the last month's rent (in solstice) but they said you had to move out by like the 15th. So basically you're staying for half a month but they still require you to pay that whole lot of money.

Oh and to top it off, they are going to charge (in my opinion) excessive amount of cleaning fees and repairs to your security deposit [from what is written in their move-out package]. To be honest, calling a cleaning service to clean the whole apartment would not cost you as bad as what they have written here. 

I don't know if all of what I stated will/will not be a problem for any of you who plan to stay here, but this certainly is a problem for me. I stayed here for 2 years despite all that, just cause I'm a lazy guy who thinks that the V Line bus is very convenient.",2016-07-21,Rafferty A.

West Village UC Davis,https://www.yelp.com/biz/west-village-davis?osq=west+village+at+uc,2.0,"I've been living here almost two months now. The short of it: nice and pretty on the outside, unprofessional and poorly managed on the inside. I'll be sure to update this at the end of my year-long lease, but so far, in my experience...

The good:
- The front desk/leasing staff I've dealt with have been so kind and helpful so far. They've got a lot to handle in regards to problems aren't directly their fault, but more the upper managements'. I credit them with doing the best they can, when they can. Thank you guys for being patient with me so far.
- Yes, it's a nice-looking place; my kitchen is relatively new and updated, the in-unit washer/dryer is great. I take off a couple points here because a lot of the touches in the apartments are cheaply done and low quality, and don't justify the price one pays for rent here, in my opinion. 
- The maintenance guys have also been really kind and helpful so far. I'm not a fan of being woken up late on a school night to banging on the front door because someone's upstairs toilet is leaking, and the maintenance crew has to come check my bathroom to see if there's leaking -- but I understand that if there's an emergency, there's an emergency, and I'd rather be made aware of the presence of someone entering my apartment late at night than not. 
- Proximity to campus is great, and the Unitrans campus shuttles are great. 

The not-so-good:
- I wasn't told by anyone before, or even on move-in day as I was handed my keys, that someone was still spending the last couple weeks of their lease in the other bedroom unit when I moved in (2 bedroom apartment). They had almost 4 months to notify me - nope. Instead, I entered my apartment for the first time on move-in day, super stoked to be living in what looked like some of the nicest apartments Davis had to offer -- followed by instant confusion over what I thought was either 1) an unclean apartment that staff hadn't bothered to refresh and clean up for a new tenant, or 2) the awkward mistake of being assigned a currently occupied apartment. Neither of these are thoughts you want to have when you move in anywhere for the first time. It appears no one told her either that someone would be moving in to share the place with her. Unacceptable and unprofessional on the management's part.
- The pesky smoke detectors, and the maintenance time turnaround. Maintenance came in to fix my alarm's loud intermittent beeping soon after I moved in (which, according to Surprise Roommate, had been a constant issue in this unit for weeks at at time). Less than a few months later, it's chirping every minute again. I'm currently on my third day of waiting for someone to come turn it off so I can sleep soundly and study without interruptions, and so my cat can stop hiding in my bathroom (the loud beeping scares him). 
- The Wi-Fi is the most unreliable I've ever had to use in a residential complex. With a large student population here that needs it for homework and research, that's not a good sign. There's a public wi-fi network for the property, and one protected network for each building. My protected network was working fine until it disappeared from my list of networks. Neither the contracted internet company nor the property management company have been able to fix it. 
- If you have a car and plan on driving to campus, you can't have a West Village permit and a campus permit concurrently. Just a heads up. Fortunately, bikes are the way to go in Davis, but if you plan on driving, that's something to be aware of.

Suggestion to West Village: I know you pride yourself on the student-friendly community atmosphere you create with pool parties and other student programming, but for the love of all that is good -- why not spend that money fixing the essential problems first so we can first and foremost live in proper, working apartments?

I had to clean out the apartment that I moved into. 

They don't clean the shared spaces of the apartment between lease terms if one person in the unit has renewed. I moved into a very dirty apartment. The floors were sticky, the walls and doors were dirty, cabinets a mess (one live roach was inside of a cabinet and rotten vegetables in another). There was also a torn up 'dumpster' sofa chair on the balcony that came with the apartment. I went to the front desk to complain and was told that it's not their responsibility. After complaining more I was told to submit an online service request (I'm there submitting it in person?) and that ""they'll see"".

I returned later in the day to find my front door left wide open with no one in the unit. An office staff apologized. The next day, carpet installers unlocked the front door and entered my unit without knocking. The only notification I had was noise outside of my bedroom. I walked out to find the front and rear doors open and workers rearranging the furniture. Only then did someone say ""maintenance"". They left for a good hour, leaving both doors open... . When the workers returned, they proceeded to play music aloud (while I was in the unit, and they knew that). That's completely disrespectful. In addition, they left grit on the floors, which I complained about. The office submitted a service request, but the floors were never cleaned. I complained about notice of entry via voicemail, email and phone. I was told that my email was forwarded to the Resident Services Manager and that I would have to discuss it with him. He never got back to me. He also did not respond to two previous emails regarding something else. A different office staff told me that they are only required to notify us if they enter the bedroom. One of the workers left a window open in a locked bedroom. I called the office to complain and was told that since we pay a flat rate for the electricity (air-conditioning), it should not matter. 

Notice of entry is such a basic courtesy. I really do not understand why they refuse to do this.
To top it off, a UCD Police statement was released that week regarding stolen property in a locked West Village unit... . Side note: one of my roommates bikes was stolen the first week last year, along with several others outside our unit. I also had a wiper blade stolen off my car.

If you want to have a say in your roommates, you need to apply as a new resident. 
That's really counter-intuitive, especially in Davis. 

Once you renew your lease, you really don't have any say in who your roommates are. I tried moving in with someone who I know a building down. We were first told to contact the Resident Services Manager, who never responded. Then we were told that all units were full and we could only move if one of the residents assigned to our unit would agree to switch. When asked for their contacts, I was told that they are still making assignments and that the reason assignments take so long is that they want to make sure everyone is happy with their room and roommate placement. I was then told that we can't switch due to how they budget cleaning the rooms. That was fairly annoying. We got assignments, and one of the residents assigned to the other person's unit switched out, but we were told that we could not switch, as they assigned someone else to that space. An email from an office staff was also not professional (""I already explained...""). 

Last week, they cut the wifi for every unit as they were upgrading the system. No prior notice was provided. Ethernet worked, but my laptop does not have an ethernet port... . If I had a conference call scheduled or something due, I'd be fairly upset. 

The exterior of my unit is fairly dirty. I complained about the peeling paint and bird droppings on the railings leading to my unit, but did not receive a response. 

I was in a similar on-campus complex in Davis which rents by the room. The common areas were cleaned in-between each lease cycle, and we were always notified in writing the week before someone would be entering our unit for service, regardless if it was the shared space or bedrooms. They also provided free parking. The $45/ month for an unassigned parking space makes no sense, especially given the high base rent. 

I think that since the majority of residents are students, management feels less of a need to be accommodating and respectful.",2016-09-08,Sean W.

Moved in for the 2015-2016 school year. Not only was my room the smallest room in the entire 4 bedroom Ramble room, but also I was left with a small closet (cut in half bc of the washer/dryer), a room that shares the wall with a TV (i can hear everything that is played through the thin walls), and a room that is directly next to the loud air conditioning mechanism. 

I had no idea that for $10 more a month, I could have gotten a bigger room. I had no idea that my closet space was smaller than everyone else's but I was paying THE SAME amount of money for it. I had to contact management to express my issues and if i never brought it up, they would have been making extra money off of me. Even with the new management Greystar, I had a difficult time getting this issue resolved. I wanted to move out at one point. Eventually they compensated with a $120 gift card, but it doesn't make living there any better. I shouldn't have to go out of my way to point out that West Village was cheating me out of my room. West Village is here to take your money and I didn't listen to the reviews the first time. I would blame my leasing agent for my issues, but honestly....I should blame myself for not looking for a place sooner. LASTLY, parking is $45 a month.

West Village UC Davis,https://www.yelp.com/biz/west-village-davis?osq=west+village+at+uc,1.0,"I lived here at West Village in the Ramble apartments by the pool for one year, from September  to August, and that was MORE THAN ENOUGH. I've lived in single family homes, slummy apartments and lovely townhouses, but this was by far my worst experience with a property management company. Although there are a few gems who work at West Village, it was such a pain in the butt living here overall that I could never recommend someone to stay with them. 

I was paying way too much for way too little space and the privilege of living at what amounts to a retirement home for students. The apartments are cheap, small and poorly planned (who doesn't provide place for a broom?). I signed my lease in a bit of a hurry and it was so difficult to get a copy of the lease from them. They kept referring me to ever changing web portals and different email addresses of management. I never actually ended up with a copy of my lease the entire time I lived there even in times when I had disputes with the management over lease issues.

Furthermore, the package system seems so nice with them singing things in and alerting you over your phone but, in my experience, it was seriously a mess. In their tiny office, packages to my apartment got lost and forgotten and misplaced. However, there were a few times when they were really helpful, such as when I had a mattress topper delivered. 

There used to be some really rude women working in the office and the only saving grace were a few of the kind leasing agents and one manager. I think they've all turned over at this point, probably because the place is so inhospitable. Honestly, I was so glad to get out of Ramble - West Village and into a new place in Davis.

They just want your money) and the manger, Terry told me that he would send me the lease document via the resident portal website but I've NEVER received any document since that day and I kept checking the website and my email inbox during the first few days.  Few days later, the manager (Terry) emailed me saying that I have to pay higher deposit of $2,148USD because I am an international student. Actually I was fine with it but then I realized that I did have SSN, so I emailed back asking him if I could provide my SSN to waive the extra deposit. As you can imagine, he didn't answer my question. I kept sending several emails to him but I got no response at all! Fine! I decided to go the lease office at West Village and tried to meet the manager in person.

I had never seen or heard of The Ramble Apartments at that time but I was so desperate for housing (this was in May) that I agreed to pay the fees and apply ASAP.

It's been 3 years since then and I'm still awestruck at how lucky I've been to call this place my home.

There are even fewer places that host major resident events and weekly treats like Taco Tuesday or breakfast on Saturdays. The facilities and amenities are unlike any other complex in Davis.

West Village UC Davis,https://www.yelp.com/biz/west-village-davis?osq=west+village+at+uc,1.0,"WORST FCKIN  MANAGEMENT EVER

Although the apartments are nice and new, it is not worth the headache. Everyone I have talked to had issues with management. I made a yelp account just to complain about this place. That's how pissed I am. 

I won't even mention, in detail, about how I got parking tickets in the past due to Ramble's inefficient and poor management skills concerning an assigned parking ""wait list."" Rather, I'll go into detail about the current situation at hand.

I came to my assigned parking spot yesterday to find a friendly note from Ramble to move my car to an unassigned spot because they wanted to power wash the carport coverings. No problem, I'm willing to move to help them out because it's a minor inconvenience to me. The note said:

""We advise our residents to move their cars to unassigned parking spots during this cleaning process. TAPS (the service that issues parking tickets) is aware of this temporary relocation and won't issue tickets.""

So I parked in a spot with no number on the ground. The next day, I was issued a ticket. Ramble's note did NOT make it clear what an ""unassigned"" space was. I parked in a 2 hour space thinking it was okay because there wasn't an assigned number-meaning it wasn't reserved for someone already. I didn't know what unassigned meant; I've always had an assigned spot. I went back to the parking lot and saw that I would have been better off leaving my car in my assigned (numbered) spot while they power washed the coverings. The girl I talked to at Ramble said that it was up to TAPS to accept my appeal or to charge me the $45 fee... So, it is apparent that Ramble doesn't work together with TAPS and they don't care what happens to their residents (even though it was Ramble's fault).

So, as I tried to make their power washing duties a little easier by listening to Ramble's instructions and moving my car, I now have to appeal to a TAPS parking citation that I may not even win. I can potentially lose $45 and I already lost the time/effort put into this. I WAS BETTER OFF LEAVING MY CAR IN MY ASSIGNED SPOT UNDER THE COVER.

The apartments are really nice, but we pay a lot of money for that. The poor management is NOT worth what we go through. 

Side Note: My roommate was emailing Ramble for weeks and never got a response about a billing error. After mentioning in an email that he knew their supervisor/boss, he got an email response within the hour. This shows a lot about how the employees treat their residents. Also, they treat us like children. They don't show respect or courtesy. Ramble is a trap. Don't live here.",2013-12-20,Hamilton L.

First time: My company sent me a work related package and it got redelivered to the Davis post office BECAUSE these people forgot to replace the names of the residents from the previous year in the mailbox. I got my package three weeks late because of a petty mistake they made. I was infuriated. Strike 1.

Second time: I was turning in my check to pay my rent and it was the last one I had on me. I'd never written a check before so I asked the front desk where I should sign. He told me to sign in an incorrect spot and then told me I need a brand new check, the same day. Typically this would be ok, but I had ran out of checks and was going to purchase new ones closer to the time the next month's rent was due. He insisted that I needed to get a check in the same day because it was the last day to pay rent before a late fee would be charged. I asked to speak to his manager because it was HIS mistake and they should at least waive the late fee until I can get a hold of more checks. The manager comes out and looks at me and goes ""How do you not know how to write a check?!"" Um HOW DARE YOU! I HATE shitty customer service. As a manager, she should be setting a better example. Strike 2. 

Third time: I live in a two bedroom at Ramble and my housemate had moved out for the summer. I had a maintenance notice on my door for a few days and one morning I woke up and SO many things in my fridge were taken or consumed. I had bought a brand new green juice the night before and woke up to see 75% of it empty along with other snacks ripped and taken out if their respective packages. THEN when I contacted them, they told me maintenance was in and they'd figure out who it was and follow up with me in a few days. A week passed by and no one knew wtf I was talking about so I had to state what had happened & my concerns AGAIN. They again told me they'd follow up with me in a few days. I was PISSED.

I won't say I haven't run into issues here, but if you move into any apartment expecting everything to go perfectly the entire time you live there, you're going to be sorely disappointed. I've only had a few minor concerns, but I'm gonna start with all the things i like about living at The Ramble.

* Super close to campus, about 10 minutes by bike with designated bike paths the whole way. 

* Utilities included in the rent, and anyone who's lived in Davis knows that's a Godsend during the summer when you want the A/C on all the time.

* Great amenities. Nice pool (actually, TWO nice pools), awesome theatre you can rent out, ping pong, pool tables, video game area (and lots of games to check out from the front desk), plus a decent-size gym upstairs in the clubhouse that's open 24 hours.

* The Hub. I was sooo excited when they opened this up. One of my major former complaints about West Village is it's not really THAT close to anything... Last year you couldn't really walk anywhere to get food or drinks or whatever. Now there's a café, a restaurant, and a convenience store no more than a 5 minute walk from my apartment. Oh, and the restaurant says they're supposed to start serving wine at some point, which will be even more awesome (at least for those of us who are 21).

* Everything is still pretty much brand new; Solstice was just finished fall of last year so it's the newest, but I live in one of the first buildings they built and it still feels like a pretty new apartment to me.

* Free printing, although they request that you not go nuts with that.

* They have nice little events and activities on a pretty regular basis. There's always a party at the pool at the beginning of the school year, and throughout the year they'll have things like Taco Tuesday (free tacos), free breakfasts sometimes, and during finals the front desk provides free testing supplies like Scantrons.

* There's a bus to school every. 15. minutes. Can't beat that.

* They let you have pets! I'd be so sad at school without my doggie 

* Good community vibe. It's all students and it's pretty easy to make friends, especially if you go to events and stuff. Everyone I've meet is super nice.

As for the bad stuff...

* The Internet can be a little unreliable, especially if you live in certain areas of certain buildings. Management is well aware of this (I'm sure they only get 500 phone calls every time it goes out), and they have been working on fixing it, so there's that. But it's usually only out for a few hours at most, and if you have an Internet emergency the clubhouse and the Hub both have the school's wifi which always works.

* Water temperature can be a problem, but that reeeally depends on the apartment you're in. My water heats up in less than 30 seconds usually but in my boyfriend's room it takes at least five minutes. Unfortunately, when you take a tour of the place you won't see the specific unit you'll be in so you can't test this.

* The actual study lounge is pretty small and can get really crowded around midterms/finals (which, really, are happening constantly between the 3rd week of school and the end of the quarter). I found this to be more of problem last year before they opened the Hub; it's not as quiet but food and coffee are only a few steps away. 

That's about it really... I have had a couple of problems with appliances but the maintenance has always been quick and responsive. The management, which seems to be people's main concern in the other reviews, haven't given me any issues and the people at the front desk are much nicer this year than they were last year.

Overall, I've had a really good experience living here. Aside from the Internet I haven't really had any recurring problems, and (even though it sometimes drives me nuts, I won't say it doesn't) the Internet's unreliability is a small price to pay for everything you get out of living here. I certainly recommend it for any Aggies looking for a place to live :-)",2014-03-07,Blair H.
West Village UC Davis,https://www.yelp.com/biz/west-village-davis?osq=west+village+at+uc,1.0,"Well, now after two years living here, FINALLY MOVING OUT. So I have to come back here and update the review, and if I could give 0 star out of 5, I would totally do so. West Village is awful. As a student, this place has the best location to campus and the living environment is great. Out of the two years living here, especially this year, it is full of frustration whenever we have to deal with the management. The staff is very uncommunicative with each other; everyone says different things. The front desk is always the only one available but they are the worst people you could go to. They could be very not clear or even give you false information but they will not bother to find out the information for you. The managers take forever to get to you, and when they do and say will fix the problems, that means never. Maintenance people are down-to-earth, nice, and willing to help you to replace anything, but the system takes forever and they never come at the time you schedule. I have cats so I always want to make sure the maintenance comes when I am here, just in case, since one of my cats run out sometimes. Guess what, they rarely come on time. I would come back home and realize they have already come in and fix everything when I ask them to come an hour later. It only gives me a feeling that the faculty is very disrespectful and unprofessional of treating their residents. With the amount of the rent I pay, I think this is VERY unworthy. By the way, they are raising the rent by around $80 or $90 next year, and I am pretty sure they still will not get their shit together.

-5 STARS for management. Every time you have a question or have a problem, they will never even try to help you. They are NEVER available to take your calls. They will return your email and say that they will help but in reality, they never do. I have experienced many many problems with them before. Below is just 1 example.

Since I change my parking permit type to a cheaper one, my monthly rent is cheaper. However, they still charge my bank the same amount (I set automatic payment). I email the manager J.D MANY MANY times about the issue. NO REPLY.

However, when I mention in my last email that I know Carley (the manager from the headquarter), he IMMEDIATELY replies my email in 2 seconds and say that he already solves it.

It only takes him a few strokes on the computer to solve the issue for me, yet never takes time to solve it until I mention I know the manager from the headquarter!

TAPS is always around to give tickets to those parking for too long in two hour parking spaces. Buses only go to the Silo, not the MU, so unless you bike or drive, prepare to walk about a mile to the other side of campus from the silo. Parking permits are also not available to residents of West Village because West Village is considered on campus housing, despite its location in the middle of nowhere past the freeway.

West Village UC Davis,https://www.yelp.com/biz/west-village-davis?osq=west+village+at+uc,1.0,"Finally got fed up with the Ramble Apartments to write a review about it. 

Outwardly, the West Village Apartments looks like a pretty nice place to live. They have 4x4s, 3x3s, 2x2s, each with their own bathrooms and they frequently offer specials and discounts for leasing. Even though it may seem new, it comes at a price. 

West Village is all about conserving energy, and I'm all for it. However, if they pretend that their apartments offer the best (the best rooms, the best leasing office, the best internet) then it better be THE best. New does NOT mean best. The first year I moved into the Rambles, our front door was broken for at least 3 months before the maintenance came to fix it. (They had to wait for the order to come in.) 

Things are frequently breaking in here. While the apartment itself costs quite a bit (one would think, expensive = good quality), the room inside is made out of cheap material. The walls are so thin, I can hear my roommates in the kitchen when they're whispering. From my room, I can hear people walking/running/stomping outside to the bus stop every morning. I CAN FEEL MY ROOM SHAKE WHEN THEY RUN PAST MY WINDOW. I can hear our upstairs neighbors drop a book on accident. I can hear people talking outside while they're walking their dogs. We use our dishwasher for drying our dishes and rarely ever use it, and it broke. Our blinds, broke. It's not like we are not purposely trying to break our apartment either but that this apartment is made out of cheap material so that when we move out and all these things are ""broken"" WE'LL be paying for it. It'll be coming out of OUR deposit. 

And the most vexing thing about the Ramble Apartments?
The internet and the management

Internet is a HUGE part of a college student's life. AND EVEN MORE SO DURING FINALS WEEK. For the TWO years I have lived in Ramble, the internet has been absolutely pathetic. They CLAIM it's the best, they CLAIM it's the fastest but it frequently doesn't work, even if you're using an ethernet cable. For TWO years I have had to deal with internet that went out and if you asked the leasing office managers to ""fix the internet"" the response you get doesn't help at all. They'll tell you to call Korcett, the internet company, because the managers can't do anything about it. 

It is not OUR job to call the company to ask them to fix the internet. Isn't that part of YOUR job description? Why do I have to do your job for you??? And how is it even remotely helpful if half the time the internet is out around 10pm? When I cannot reach either the leasing office OR the internet company? 

Why do you insist on upgrading the internet to a faster speed? It doesn't matter if it's faster if it doesn't even work. The past WEEK I've been calling Korcett to ask if the  have fixed the internet. At first it's ""It'll be fixed in a few days"", then it's ""I have confirmation that it is fixed now"". Excuse me, but if it lags to the point where I cannot open the page without disconnecting from the internet, IT IS NOT FIXED. So instead of trying to ""upgrade your internet speed"", FIX. IT. FIRST. Do you want to know why I'm so furious with this??? BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN BADGERING KORCETT ABOUT FIXING THE INTERNET COMPANY LAST WEEK FOR MIDTERMS AND THEY TELL ME IT'S FIXED. I HAVE HAD TO DEAL WITH LAGGY INTERNET FOR A WEEK AFTER I MADE MY CALLS AND NOW I CAN'T EVEN STUDY FOR FINALS AND IT'S THE NEXT WEEK. THEY ARE EQUALLY AS USELESS AS YOU LEASING MANAGERS. That is TWO weeks the internet has been acting up and NOTHING has happened. Oh, in fact, I'm disconnecting right now. I'm writing this rant WHILE the internet is down.

So help me God, I know I can use the leasing office to study but no one wants to pack their bags at 2-4AM IN THE MORNING, to walk over to leasing office to get their crap done. I shouldn't have to be resorting to this. 

Why Korcett anyways? Comcast would have been a better internet company. Oh wait a minute, I forgot. You guys only like to invest in cheap things that break, then charge the rest of us triple the price.",2014-03-15,Connie C.
West Village UC Davis,https://www.yelp.com/biz/west-village-davis?osq=west+village+at+uc,4.0,"edit on 10/2014: I have removed a star because service is truly incompetent and even rude here sometimes. Still good facilities, but man their front office staff...Smh.


A comment on facebook led me to view this page in interest, and I was so appalled when I saw all the poor reviews that I decided I had to write one to counter it. Now keep in mind that I ONLY have a desire to review when I feel like a place's reviews are not what they deserve (whether positive or negative) and that in no way am I affiliated with West Village or something so I feel obligated to write false positives. I'm simply a regular resident who's been living in the Rambles specifically for a year, and am planning to do yet another year. It's pretty much the best place to live in Davis - if you're trying to get your money's worth. Sure, there are places for $300 rent/month out there, and I pay $800/month. But it's so worth it. Here's the reasons why:

- it's fucking new. I was the first resident in my apartment. SPANKING NEW. I love that. No one else has sat on the toilet seat before me. CLEAN AND NEW.

- Everything is included in the rent already. $800 might sound hefty but it sure is worth it when you consider that I have Internet provided, and nearly unlimited utilities usage as well. I can take 1 hour long showers everyday and turn on the AC 24-hours at no extra cost.

- Free service requests. All I gotta do is go to the front office, be like yo my tub is clogged, and a guy will come fix it for me free and pronto.

- My room is pretty fucking big. And comes with furniture. And a great view. I don't have to worry about moving in huge beds and crap like others. I even got a free TV perk. I have my own bathroom. I have my own walk-in closet. I HAVE A WASHER AND DRYER. Life doesn't get much better for a college student.

- The place is pet-friendly. 

- The place is friendly. Well, ok, some ppl at the front office could smile a little more, but most of the staff are pretty nice and helpful. 

- I get so many perks. Free food, events every month for residents, $300 gift cards for renewing and all kinds of other bribery. I honestly can't complain.

- Someone was complaining about packages. I haven't had a problem. I get my mail efficiently and easily.

- There's guest parking right next to my building, super handy. another bonus.

- The apartments just look nice. The clubhouse looks nice. Oh yea. The clubhouse. Being a resident gives you access to: their 24hour study lounge and gym, with free printing and everything. The gym is pretty sick. Has a dance floor and random tanning machine too. And downstairs we've got a gaming room with your usual foosball and stuff, and then ALL THE GAMING SYSTEMS (PS3, Wii, etc) hooked up to TVS with games available for you to play. The clubhouse even has a theater in it. And a sick set of 3 pools, BBQ area, locker rooms, volleyball pit, etc. I mean, what more do you want, honestly.

- Now they've opened up a marketplace, cafe and restaurant. While all places are pricey, it's definitely convenient. And the restaurant makes some damn good pasta. And they take Aggie Cash which makes me happy.

- The layouts of the whole community looks nice. It's aesthetically pleasing. I love it. I'm very materialistic, I know.

- Personal V bus line that comes every 15 minutes now.

- And there's more but I'm already sounding too much like an advertisement.

Anyways, whatever. That's why I like West Village and I think all the reviewers below are mostly harsh and unrealistic. I mean, sure. There are places that West Village can improve on. Nothing is ever perfect though, and for a college community, I think it's pretty decent. I mean, I could be at the Lexington or something, where apparently rent can be $750/month..... but they have to buy their own water, furniture, Internet, cable, and there's a BIG electricity cap. And apparently where they must buy some random State Farm Insurance for $500 before they can even move in. Add all that together and I'm way over the $800/month I pay to stay here at the Rambles, and that place isn't even new or half as pretty as West Village. I'd be crazy to stay there. Or, sure, I could rent a room in a house downtown for $300/month, but it'd be old, dirty, cramped, and I'd be sharing all my bathrooms and personal space with WAY too many people. Not worth it.

All in all, West Village seems expensive at a quick glance, but it's worth it when you take a closer look.",2013-09-10,Alice H.

Second, they have free printing in the office. however, the printing machine always not working. I brought my own printing machine because the one in office are always out of ink or not working. Seriously, I pay more than 800 dollars every months. and where are the money goes? This is not what I expect to get for paying 800 dollars.

Third, parking permits is also a problem. They have plenty of parking space available, however, some of my friends brought a car and tried to apply for a parking permit. They said:""sorry but we don't have any parking space available."" and my friends need to find out other place to live. The parking permits are also expensive, you can get really good free parking space by living in other place in Davis.

Fourth, the officers. They are nice when you apply to live in the west village, but when you move in. the attitude changes. When I ask questions, they explain it with confusion and also not very good attitude. They are all students so you know.....

West Village UC Davis,https://www.yelp.com/biz/west-village-davis?osq=west+village+at+uc,1.0,"I would give this place 0 stars if it were possible. Like many of the other reviewers on this page my experience with West Village management has been nothing short of abysmal. My advice to anyone seeking housing is to avoid this place like the plague. Yes, the facilities are very nice but that crap that you must endure before, during, and after your stay is NOT worth the trouble. 

1st incident: I was urged my leasing staff to sign my contract in January to ensure that my preferences would be met. **NOTE: any preferences you put down on your papers and preferences and just that despite any guarantees anyone at the leasing office makes you. This became very apparent when I received an e-mail from the leasing office, a mere week before it was time to move in. Many of my friends who had also signed a lease with West Village had received their housing assignments many weeks before hand despite signing their leases later than my roommates and I. The e-mail that my intended roommates and I received stated that all the 4 bedroom apartment options had ""sold out"" and that we could no longer be housed together. To further rub salt in the wound, we were told we could either live separately and be housed with complete strangers, or 3 out of the 4 of us could choose to pay more and live in a 3 bedroom unit. When my roommates and I visited the office to speak to leasing staff, the front office assistants blatantly lied to us and said that no one with authority over the matter was present. After pressing further, the leasing manager finally came out of hiding, and yelled at us saying that she was ""swamped"" and had no time to meet with us, and that we should ""take or leave"" the options we were given then curtly turned to walk back into her office. When I asked about the 26 hour deadline we were given, she said that if we wanted any of her time then we would have to e-mail her. I asked if we could just have a moment of her time to discuss the matter and she VERY RUDELY said no and walked back into her office. 

Complaining to the community manager, who I understand was recently fired, was of no use either. My roommates and I sent several e-mails over a period of nearly a month and we never received a response. It was not until we went to the office and demanded to speak with him in person that we were able to secure an appointment time to speak with him, but that was also little to no help at all since all he did in response to our complaints was give us excuses about how stressed the leasing manager is and that West Village was not at fault. 

2nd incident: California Consumer Affairs requires landlords to refund, minus any deductions, security deposits to tenants within 21 calendar days after they move out. It has been nearly a month and I still have not received my refund, nor any word of any deductions. I sent a couple of e-mails to the leasing staff and even called the office and received no response via e-mail and the assistant at the front desk was VERY RUDE and blamed the post office for possibly losing my check then advised that I wait another 2 days to receive a response to my e-mail. Which reminds me to mention that the students hired to work the front desk have no sense of how to treat customers!!! Given that West Village is a ""professional office"" you would think that it would be common sense to at least send a check with such a large sum of money via certified mail or the like. I was so incredibly disappointed with the service I had received that I decided to send an e-mail to customer relations at the corporate office. And magically that 2 day wait time came down to me receiving a response within the hour. 

Overall, AVOID THIS PLACE! Management sucks and they will put you through hell before AND after you've moved out. Take your business elsewhere!!!",2014-09-30,Katherine K.
West Village UC Davis,https://www.yelp.com/biz/west-village-davis?osq=west+village+at+uc,1.0,"The most valuable piece of information is the fact that of the 30+ people I know currently living in the West Village, only 2 of them are renewing their lease. West Village has the worst renewal rate in all of Davis at below 50%. Personally I would recommend finding somewhere else to live for nearly half the rent. If given a second chance, I would have researched off campus housing a bit more and found a different place to live.
I feel it is time to leave my feedback on the experiences I had there. I will admit that I did not have the greatest time here and there are many things that have pissed me off over the course of my lease but all of this is the truth.
I'm going to start with management because they are the biggest complaint among anyone who lives here. Management straight up is horrible. I have had numerous encounters with them and I end up hating them more and more. They lost one of my checks for my monthly rent, waited until after the grace period and then charged me with a $75 fine. I told them I had sent it in 2 weeks ago but they refused to budge so I offered to pay again via their online portal so that they couldn't lose my check again. They refused and said I would need to pay in cash or check so I had to get another check mailed to me so I could give it to them in person.
I had a piece of workout equipment that I stored outside my apartment in a fenced off, cement, ""patio"" type area. It was never a problem, no one complained about it because it was not visible from the outside. However, management took offense to my equipment and told me I had to get rid of it or else everyone in my apartment would be fined for its removal. Apparently we don't lease that fenced off area outside our door even though 2nd floor and up get a patio. If you walked down the entire row of apartments, everyone stored stuff in the first floor ""patio"" area. I really didn't understand this policy and was forced to get rid of a very valuable, important piece of property. No one else was ever forced to remove their stuff.
The Jacuzzi is broken a lot and is quite disgusting. It is literally a bowl of dead bugs and the water often turns a shade of green. Also, the Jacuzzi closes at 10pm every day of the week! As if anyone wants to go in the Jacuzzi before 10.
There was an incident where a student was having a beer while studying in one of the lounges. The student was not being belligerent or anything. I do agree with their enforcement of the ""open container"" policy and the student should not have been drinking but management acquired a photo of the student with the beer in their hand and posted it on Facebook stating that the 24 hour privileges would be revoked for the solstice lounge because of this person. That is incredibly unprofessional and they should have taken different action in how they dealt with this situation.
The internet sucks. A lot. There are nights where the internet just disappears. At the beginning of the year they had the entire proximity (all three apartment areas) running on the same wifi. As you could imagine, it didn't work. After weeks of telling us that they were working on a solution, renaming the wifi, and having the wifi shut off for days, they ""fixed it."" The internet is still spotty and turns off a lot. I've missed multiple homework assignments that had to be turned in online because of this.
Make sure you understand your lease is up August 15 and you must move out at that date. That leaves half of a month between then and the start of most leases. Additionally, they charge rent for the ENTIRE month of August. That's $800+ for 15 days. Ridiculous. And if you want to move out early (like at the end of the school year in June) you cannot turn in your key then. You can only turn it in up to a week before August 15. 
Our apartments were brand new and we were the first people to live in them. That was a definite plus. However, when we moved in the doors had not been sealed on the bottom (bug/wind proofing) so therefore the entire apartment was covered in dust and dead bugs. It was disgusting and we ended up having to clean it all on our own with no acknowledgement from management. The doors still have some gaps under them so we have bug issues. There are spiders appearing all the time and we had a big ant problem mid-year. My roommate got bitten one night by a spider and had a huge welt for a week.
I can go on forever but Yelp has a character limit. Hopefully this won't get deleted like most of their other negative posts so people can read more than just the good reviews. Basically if I could sum up the West Village apartments I would describe it as a ""resort style"" complex that treats its residents like they pay half of what they do to live there.",2014-06-09,Doug W.
West Village UC Davis,https://www.yelp.com/biz/west-village-davis?osq=west+village+at+uc,1.0,"If you read other reviews you get the point that management sucks, now let me tell a few things other reviewers have forgot to mention. Yes utilities are included and yes the ramble can even come furnished for an extra small fee but in the end, its not worth it. The internet is slow! They sent out a letter that the internet was going to be 2x faster at no extra cost..... it hasn't been. I was lucky to get my apartment for cheap because everywhere they placed me there was a roommate who was allergic to dogs (i was bringing my dog) and they placed me in a complex, 3x3, a day before move-in date. I never got to get in contact with my new roommates.

Anyways if you read the contract, you pay extra if you go over there limits on the amount of water, gas, and electric amount they provide for each individual. So even though people say its free its limited. So you cannot have a mini fridge because it takes up too much voltage. 

Other apartments like the one I am living in next year (2x2), are cheaper. I am going to pay for electric and gas bills but it will not exceed over $700 max for rent/laundry/utilities/internet and the ramble I was paying $814 and that was because of the roommate issue normally it would have been $925 for a 2x2.

There are so many college students(all are college students) they are so noisy! And RUDE! On the first week I was living here I took my dog out to a patch of grass in front of my complex to do her business and I saw a chicken neck on the grass! Things like this are so common. No one ever picks up their dog's poop, many dogs are not leashed and there is a guy on the third floor of my complex who always has his dog downstairs while he is inside his apartment.... no one is watching his dog! And the guys above our building always smoke and throw their cigarette buds in front of our door! The Ramble is suppose to be smoke free! 

The move out is ridiculous. I am moving out soon and they have such a high demand. First off, the majority of their things such as furniture and appliances are CHEAP. But the charges to replaces it are outrageous. They will find anything to charge you. They have a fee for the amount of cleaning they have to do even if its almost nothing! From past experiences every apartment complex has to clean each apartment for new residents, they expect us to do that for them and will charge us for anything they have to do. If accidentally leave a piece of paper behind they will charge you $25 for trash removal, how insane. If anyone has ever had carpet they will know that even if you do not spill anything on it after a year the carpet won't be new anymore. The scruffs will not be as soft. And they charge $75 for carpet cleaning and $325 for carpet replacement. Why do apartments have carpet! Carpet gets old FAST!

Do not get me started on parking! I brought my car in the beginning of the year and could not get a permit and placed me on a wait list. I received three tickets in the first quarter. They have 2 hour guest parking. If you do not move your car you will get ticketed. But i was in school from 11-4pm how can I move my car? And if you live in the Ramble you cannot get a parking permit to park on campus. They informed me that if I had a permit I will get fined $300 and my permit will be confiscated (the manager told me this!) Wow the Ramble doesn't allow me to have a permit from them nor the school. Parking at school daily would cost me $40 a week without a permit. I did not bring my car up during during Winter quarter I decided my boyfriend was going to give me lifts if I needed them (he does not live here) and in the middle of Winter Quarter I was getting charged an extra $25 so I emailed the management. Never got a response. Soon I got an email that I needed to pay the $25 immediately so I replied to that email asking why. The manager finally responded telling me that it was for parking. How in the world was I being charged if I never got an email saying I was off the waitlist. I was never even given a permit or the information of my vehicle. The manager told me he was going to take me off the list...The next month I got the same thing. I called him up this time and he told me he had taken me off the list but doesn't know why I was being charged. So once again he said he took me off the list. He actually did this time. A week later I got an email saying ""we have a parking spot open for you. You have until so and so to reserve your spot"" Half the school year past until I finally had a parking spot. I was getting charged even when there wasn't even a spot open.

 And they are building more complexes what they need is a parking structure!!! So many students live here you need to guarantee one parking spot per student since everyone has to live in one room (no shared rooms). You get an average of $900 per person living here and the Ramble really cannot make room for student parking. The majority of students are 2nd years and above so they usually have a car!!",2014-06-10,Jessica A.
West Village UC Davis,https://www.yelp.com/biz/west-village-davis?osq=west+village+at+uc,2.0,"I lived at The Ramble the first year it was open, from September 2011-August 2012 in a 2 bedroom. My rent was $955/month plus an additional $12.50/month for a covered tandem parking space.

Some pros are: 
- The gym. Really nice, each machine has a TV attached to it, and it's generally not very crowded (unlike the ARC) however that was only when half of the units were occupied.
- Each room has its own bathroom (although this is also a con because guests have to walk through your room to use the bathroom, there is no bathroom accessible from the main living area.)
- Washer & dryer in unit 
- Nice kitchen appliances (with the exception of a really small microwave). 
- Brand new! Clean, nice floors, nice cabinets. 
- Nice TV (that stays in the apartment) and one month free rent special when we signed our lease. Not sure if this is still being offered. 

I know this complex is new so they are still working out the kinks, however there have been quite a few problems this year.

Some cons are: 
- Parking. The covered spot is not worth it. The covers are so high that it does not protect your car against rain, and only moderately protects the car from the sun when it's hot. Not worth the price. Also, tandem parking is extremely inconvenient and really expensive ($25/month) for your a single parking spot. It is better to get an uncovered reserved spot because you are not going to ever be ""boxed in"" to your parking spot. If you and your roommate both drive a lot, DO NOT get tandem parking. Biggest pain ever to have to move your car at random times or not be able to get into your parking spot. The issue is that there is a reserved spot behind your tandem spot so there were times where I was in the inside tandem but was still able to get out because no one was parked behind me, but I returned home 20 minutes later and someone had parked there so my roommate would have to come down and move her car so I could get in. This would not happen if you had a ""normal"" tandem spot. Also, it took me 40 minutes to scrape my parking permit off my car after I moved out. So that was annoying. 

- Guest parking. There is none. When my friends came to visit for the weekend, they had to park at my friends' house on the other side of Davis and I had to go pick them up. There is only 2 hour visitor parking that is enforced M-F 10:00am-6:00pm. The Ramble argues that your friends can stay for the weekend, but the catch is they can park in a visitor spot on a Friday at 4pm (no earlier) and won't have to move their car until Monday at 10:00am. When we signed our lease they said there would be guest passes, but then when we asked after move-in they acted like they never said that. I would have seriously considered not living here had I known that it would almost be impossible for my friends to come visit (for longer than two hours) because The Ramble is not located near any shopping centers or anything so there is really nowhere for visitors to park.

- Packages. They do not notify you when you get a package, and then send out e-mails complaining that their mail room is full and residents need to pick up their packages. Many apartments send out a mass e-mail each day to the residents that received a packages, it's not a very difficult task and I don't see why someone in their office could have that responsibility.

- Pets. Dogs are allowed at the Ramble, however there is a 40lb weight limit so there are quite a lot of small, yappy dogs. We unfortunately live above an apartment where a Chihuahua lives and because it is cooped up, alone in an apartment all day, it barks incessantly. I have also been woken up to dogs barking very loudly at each other while on a walk through the complex.

- Internet - The internet in this complex is awful. It goes out constantly, and when it does work, it runs painfully slow. I have had to go to friend's houses late at night because the internet died while I was trying to study. I recently bought a TV episode off of iTunes, and it has taken 4 hours to download this show. The internet is extremely unreliable and definitely the biggest consistent problem for residents. I've recently been on The Ramble facebook page and the internet is still a constant problem right now. 

Overall, I would not live here again. Yes, it is a very nice apartment, but definitely not worth the price. Even if we did not have as many problems, I still think it's just too expensive. There are plenty of nice apartments and houses in Davis that are much more affordable.",2013-03-20,Sam G.

West Village UC Davis,https://www.yelp.com/biz/west-village-davis?osq=west+village+at+uc,1.0,"The Ramble Apartment is the worst apartment complex in Davis, hands down. They only opened last year. Go to davis wiki and look at the terrible reviews. You don't want to live there. 

Firstly, the apartments are made of the worst materials possible. They hastily constructed everything. There are problems everywhere. Maintenance is so slow and unresponsive. Management is rude and untruthful. They are very shady. 

Next, the place is overpriced. Who pays $1000 for just 1 bedroom in a 2 bedroom apartment? That's insane. The 1 bedroom apartments here are over $1700 per month. Ridiculous. This isn't USC or Harvard. We at UC Davis aren't so rich. 

Finally, the zero net energy and environmental thing is BS. They are so wasteful in resources. You get unlimited electricity and water. Also, they keep giving out plastic marketing shit like frisbees, cups, etc. Plus, the internet sucks- very unreliable. Construction noises are also very loud. This will continue for the next few years. 

Buyer Beware. Don't move here.",2012-05-13,Steven M.
West Village UC Davis,https://www.yelp.com/biz/west-village-davis?osq=west+village+at+uc,1.0,"Update: The management will also try to keep all your deposit and more after you move out by manufacturing all the things like charging $25 for  a bag of trash you did not leave. It does not matter how well you clean the unit, they will still charge you for the cleaning. They  conveniently forget about any credit you had. 

Don't move in here! Avoid horrible experiences. No wonder Sacramento Bee states ""Despite those luxuries, West Village has had a hard time keeping tenants, with about 50 percent of them declining to renew their leases in 2012, not including those who graduated. Citywide, the average renewal rate is closer to 70 percent""
     The luxuries are only on the surface. The front door broke immediately after moving in and took the maintenance a few months before they replaced it and the new one did not even work well. Though the building just finished last year(2012), the paint are peeling off in many area and the floor is fading in addition to the window was installed wrong and it could never be shut.

     The worst of of all, the management is mean and deceptive. They try to squeeze extra money out of you in any way possible even if it is illegal. They advertised and assured us that the one bedroom of the 2 bedroom unit to be $776 per month including the utility and collected the deposit in June, but they waited till close to the move in time before they actually showed the rental agreement with the rent amount of $ 963. When I questioned about it, they explained that they will give 1 month free rent and $550 concession. I pointed out that it is still way more than they said it will be per month. Then they changed their story saying that there will be one and half month rent credit and $ 800 concession, but there will be fee for amortize these specials. I told them it does not need to be amortized. Then they tried to charge extra for getting 3rd floor unit when we did not ask for it. They assigned us the unit without asking our preference.( They say they cannot honor any preference.)  I pointed out that being on the 3rd floor is more troublesome for moving as we have to carry furniture up and down the stairs as they don't have elevators.  They insisted it was better because of the privacy and insisted on charging extra for it. I never heard of 3rd floor extra charge. How ridiculous can they get?

              Of course we decided not to renew the lease and deducted the holding deposit from the last month rent. They charged us $ 75 as late fee for not paying the full rent amount threatening legal action, though the rental agreement does not state the holding deposit becomes security deposit.

               When we asked to have an extra day as a new apartment is not available till September 1st, they utterly refused saying the inspection is to be done at 7 am on that day and they had to do the work before new tenants moved in. ( They did not let us move in till September 12th though they counted the full 30 days of September as rental days.)   As we had no other choice, we moved out in the morning of September 1st.  Nobody came till 10 am and it was no problem as there were a lot of other apartments to inspect. Now they are charging us $96( 3 X daily rental amount) for being half a day late moving out though the rental agreement does not state the penalty. I know it is illegal to charge rent from two different people for the same place during the same time period.

 They also charge $ 265 per year to park your car there and they only have very limited 2 hour parking spaces for guests. There are no street parking space available nearby, either. The apartment buildings are designed poorly and it is long walk from any parking space to apartment units and it is real pain to move in and out, especially on the 3rd floor. Buses to UC come only every half hour during weekdays and every hour on weekend and during Summer, tough they told us it comes every 15 minutes.",2013-09-03,Cindy B.
West Village UC Davis,https://www.yelp.com/biz/west-village-davis?osq=west+village+at+uc,1.0,"Please note: This is a review for the Solstice Apartments, the newest addition to the WV family. EVERYONE who's looking at leasing at WV, DON'T. DO NOT LEASE HERE. DON'T DO THIS TO YOURSELF. 

5 stars for the amenities (maybe). This place comes with a gym, a pool, a jacuzzi, 24 hour study rooms, movie theater, gaming system, pool table, free printing (which by the way, breaks down OFTEN) , and heck, even a tanning bed. As far as complimentary services: free breakfast on Saturdays, a cafe/diner located right in the middle of the square, a private busline (V) and a beautiful color-filled apartment complex straight out of a Tim Burton film. 

Trust me, at first glance (and even a second, third, and fourth glance) like a college student's dream place. 

Not. So. 

The problem here isn't the rent (814 for the smaller room in a 4x4, 10 bucks extra for the bigger room in a 4x4) or that once school hits, you won't even have time to use the numerous complimentary services this place...

IT'S THE MANAGEMENT.

Maintenance, construction, the office staff...take your pick because they're all a nightmare to deal with. (Please note that there are employed students who work in the office and they've all been pretty helpful.)

As a resident who's currently living here (and wishes nothing more than to move out), here are a few experiences: 

Move-in day: The countertop was damaged. Ok, no big. They're in construction (and still are, by the way. I had a large nail punctured into my tire last month as proof) and were trying to get all the apartments ready. The office informed us that that someone was going to come in to fix the countertops. And they did. Twice. They came the first time, and they sort of pounded on the door and when I asked them if they were here for the counter, they sort of just came in. Whatever. They did say they were coming in that day, and lo and behold, they did their job. The second time was a few days later. No call, no email, no nothing. The group of guys came into the kitchen, unannounced, and uninvited. I asked them what they were doing there. They said ""for the counter"" and I told them that the counter was already fixed. They sort of ignored me after that and gathered around the 2-in spot of plaster in the middle of the counter. 

Calling in maintenance: My housemates and I have called maintenance a dozen times because *SPOILER ALERT* the apartments are made with pretty cheap material. Trust me, we don't throw parties or do anything to abuse the furniture. And when we do call, there are two options: one) have maintenance come in at any time whenever they aren't busy or two) have maintenance come in at a certain time (say between 1pm and 5pm) but there's no guarantee that they'll come into the apartment anytime soon.

House Issues: For the privacy of my house, I won't say a lot about what's been going on, but let's just say, a facilitated meeting with all the housemates is much needed. The house has been having problems since Month 1, and issues have escalated from there. We've emailed the office about these issues (they have a community manager ((unresponsive)) and an assistant community manager ((a bit rude, unhelpful, and unresponsive)) to deal with house issues in the complex) and they essentially said deal with it yourself. To put in very nicely, the house environment is extremely unpleasant to leave in.

I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE STATED TO EVERYONE WHO'S THINKING ABOUT LEASING HERE: I was speaking with a police officer recently and he said that they've been getting A LOT of reports coming out of West Village concerning house issues and roommates, and unless they're an actual threat of violence and physical harassment, they can't do anything about it. He suggested that everyone who makes a report really put pressure on West Village management to get their act together and deal with it. 

(By the way, there are a few cop cars stationed around WV and a newly instated Nighttime patrol. Oh goodie.)

ALERT TO EVERYONE: Management made it very clear: unless there is a violation of lease, they can't do anything about it or get involved. So pick housemates wisely.*

*To be fair, you could go Student Judicial Affairs about house issues and let them deal with it. 

Then there are the usual lies they dish out: the busline comes every 15 minutes (it's every 30), great wifi (personally, I think it's pretty crappy but I've heard different), privacy (the walls are really thin), the great clubhouse (it's still under construction in Solstice), free printing (bring your own), package arrival (again, crappy for me, ok for others), the bikepath that runs to campus (it's pretty isolated and scary to bike there at night), etc

In my opinion, I find everyone else's reviews here to be pretty accurate. This review is based on my personal experiences living here. For all I know, my personal experience is one of those rare exceptions and WV is actually a great place to live.",2013-12-01,Andi V.
West Village UC Davis,https://www.yelp.com/biz/west-village-davis?osq=west+village+at+uc,1.0,"The facilities here are awesome. Very new although it seems like its built in a rush. However, the management here sucks. I mailed in my deposit on a personal check, and the assistant manager told me that I have to use a cashier's check. So I mailed the cashier's check few days later and asked more than twice E.S. whether she has received my check, but I NEVER received a reply until my move in date. On the move in date, they said that I have not paid my deposit, and said that they never received my check and said that maybe it was misplaced because I used a different name on the check, and that they will NEVER cash the check they are unsure of, and will just put those checks aside. I even asked to talk to E.S. but she always seems to be unavailable, and she NEVER replied my email. So okay, I'll wait 3 months to do a stop payment on my check. 

3 months later, I went to the bank, and the bank told me that west village has cashed my check. I went and asked NICELY to the leasing agent about the problem. So the leasing agent went in and asked E.S, and he came out, with an accusing tone, asking if I have a proof. WOW. Not the kind in which he asked nicely, but ""do you have any proof"" in a mean accusing tone. So I asked to talk to E.S and she is FINALLY available. And she claimed that she have met me and talked to me several times 3 months ago. WOW. I have never even seen her face and she said that she talked to me before?? really??? SOOOO, long story short. She asked for proof and I gave the pic of endorsement the bank gave me and she said that the management NEVER electronically cash checks and she will check in with the accounting department. Still no apologies, and still talking to me in an unpleasant tone. She finally emailed me saying that they found the check and yes, they have cashed it. wow. what a liar. and still, blaming me for everything that has happened. I don't even know how she got hired in the first place.

Not my choice DO NOT LIVE AT THIS PLACE EVEN IF IT MEANT YOU WOULD BE HOMELESS. My daughter attended UNT and she lived in 5 different places. A new one every year. We had a great experience at all other 4 places but I would only recommend this place to my worst enemy. The management  team have to be the most dishonest people I have ever dealt with. When we moved her in the room was not cleaned very well. It was already a little run down. The bathroom was dingy. The carpet was tired and faded.So we had to clean the Bathroom and the Room and we bought a huge throw rug. She didn't hang anything on the walls. It was her last year so she just needed a place to sleep close to campus and place to park. That is all they are good for. When it came time to move out, she checked out and they said everything was fine. Well-they sent a bill many months later for a bunch of bogus charges. Repaint her room, clean the carpet and clean the room. Here is the problem. We cleaned the room so good, it was better than when she moved in. In the previous 4 years we never had a single bill from any other apartments. They actually commented how clean we left the place. So I tried on many occasions to contact someone at 33. the managers were never able to come to the phone. Always busy and they never called backed. So after about six attempts we gave up.  Since we didn't pay the bill, their Corporate (GreyStar)out of Washington came after us. They are even bigger crooks. We contested it and they told us, Sorry Pay or go to collections. They even commented that the management at 33 wouldn't respond. They wouldn't address our concerns. Just said pay us or fight with collections. So I didn't want to ruin my credit since I was a cosigner.
If you decide to live at 33, just be prepared for them to screw you, big time. They are crooks and know there is nothing you can do. We tried to make it right and plead our case but no one would listen and didn't care. Usually when I have issues, I just don't respond, but in this case I feel that I need to warn people. All we wanted was a chance to talk to someone about the situation, but these people would not discuss it all. We just wanted to talk to one person about the situation. Not one person would discuss the issues. Pay or go to collections",2017-02-02,Gary W.

33 North,https://www.yelp.com/biz/33-degrees-north-apartments-denton,1.0,"As I type this glowing review for 33 Degrees North, the smoke detector is beeping away in intervals of 30 seconds in one of the bedrooms. Here is my advice if you absolutely have to live here. DO NOT LIVE ON THE FIRST FLOOR. I repeat, DO NOT LIVE ON THE FIRST FLOOR. This is true for just about any apartment complex ever, but don't let the 50ft ceilings here (first floor only perk, yeah right) fool you. Thanks to a former roommate, I enjoy the sporadic beeping of not one, but 6 smoke detectors total, the stomping and furniture moving of the lovely neighbors above us, the loud slamming of a security gate on the other side of my room, and the lovely acoustics of my ex-roommate and her boyfriend. She's gone now, but still. No thank you. Another thing, our cap on electricity does not accommodate said ceilings, so expect to pay overages every month when the heat is on for otherwise normal usage. My other roommate and I are not extravagant users of wattage by any means so its getting kind of ridiculous. In fact, our thermostat is set to 62 degrees right now and I'm cold. Very cold. I really do want to love this place as it is furnished with ""decent"" furniture, one of the only places with an actual parking garage in Denton, most of the utilities are paid for, and it's within walking distance to campus. Ok I lied about the furniture. *Most* of it is ok but who needs a queen sized bed in college?? It takes up more than half the room, and the ""pillowtop"" mattress it came with sucks, so I had to put a 4 inch memory foam topper on it, meaning I get on it like the princess and the pea to go to bed every night. Ugh. Another thing, if you were lucky enough to get the new faux wood floors when you moved in because your apartment's previous owners trashed them, don't count your blessings. Walking on them barefoot will inexplicably leave your soles black as soot every time, despite multiple cleanings with every cleaning product I could get my hands on. Socks and slippers will be your best friend here. Another great thing about living on the first floor are the floor to ceiling windows that give passersby a peepshow every night! No, seriously. You will also be blinded by the sun every time it sets if you happen to be living on whatever side that happens on. It's awesome. Our balcony is basically useless too unless you like standing and/or smoking because anyone can climb over it and steal your stuff. Which hasn't happened to use because we're not stupid. Other people are risking the lives of their chairs by keeping them on their first-floor balconies so props to them. I personally like hopping over my balcony to bring in the groceries when I'm lazy and there's street parking available.  Hmm. We also have super big garden tubs which are great for taking hot baths $$$ in a freezing cold apartment. Oh totally forgot about my bathroom door. It doesn't close. It never has. I thought I locked myself in there the other week and I didn't have my phone or any food on me so I thought I was going to die. I didn't though or I wouldn't be writing this review. So in short, live here at your own risk! It's very hit or miss.",2015-02-17,Marissa L.
University View,https://www.yelp.com/biz/university-view-college-park,2.0,"You can't complain about the location. Adjacent to campus, a few good enough eateries nearby (Sweet Greens and Fishnet), and close to ""thriving"" downtown College Park (kind of an armpit, but for a college student great fun). The apartments are a strange hybrid of dorms and apartments. There is a living/dining area and a 1980s style kitchen. It's odd when you arrive, b/c on the outside it looks like a modern living space, but when you arrive inside it seems kind of dumpy.

I believe the real problem with the View is management. They are underwhelming. If you have a repair need or complaint they make a showing of fixing it without really doing so. My daughter had a stove/oven that needed repairing and they never fixed it. What is really annoying, however, is their accounting. Beware of fees. They come regularly and it is never clear what they are for. There appear to be hidden fees in the utilities. The accounting is never clear, charges are rarely explained, and normal cleaning required upon transfer of apartment they charge for - oven cleaning (when the oven was not terribly dirty), carpet cleaning (not for stains, but for normal wear), and anything you can name they will take from your security deposit. It's probably worth shopping around. The Enclave and Varsity are nearby, but I can't attest to their experience. Check them out though. Also, you pay monthly for a 12 month lease, but you move in late August, and have to move out end of July. If you keep the same apartment, then you can just stay in that apartment and leave your belongings there. If you change, say from a 4 BR to a 2BR, then out you go at the end of July, and you have to store your things until late August.

The View is more of an upscale dorm than a bonafide apartment. If you don't mind paying a little over $1000/mo for a dorm then go for it, b/c it is close to campus. If you want an apartment experience, maybe some of the Apartments near Ikea and the Beltway are a better option.",2016-08-12,Steve V.
University View,https://www.yelp.com/biz/university-view-college-park,2.0,"The View isn't terrible, it has a great location near campus and the 4B/4B in View 1 is what worked best for me and my friends. There are now two gyms - the one in V1 is pretty small but sufficient, and the new one in V2 is larger and more equipped. There are study rooms which are great if you manage to grab one.

However, they always manage to find a way to charge you for such little things but they won't tell you what they are. My rent is supposed to be $919/month but it always ends up near $1000. The apartments themselves aren't exactly luxury; you have a very thin carpet covering a concrete floor, and it gets dirty so quickly. The kitchen floor is sticky no matter what we do and the appliances are incredibly old. If you're lucky you'll get a leather couch instead of one of the cheap polyester couches they're trying to put in apartments now. 

Whenever there's an event at the view where they're giving away free food/T-shirts, you need to go like 30 minutes before it even begins just to wait in line. If you go right on time or a bit after, expect to wait in line for the rest of your life. The building can be pretty loud on weekends. Last year we had an apartment under us that would play loud 90s music pretty much 24/7 but this year we've had no problems with that, so it really just depends on your luck.

I love this apartment for the great memories it brought me at College Park, not the apartment itself. They need to stop renovating the 4th floor and the entrance every single year and instead put that money to putting hardwood floors in the apartments and giving us upgraded appliances.",2016-06-02,Lydia V.

Besides, they had shown a completely different demo room and I got something absolutely different. 
Just as I enter my apartment the kitchen starts and the hall ends. Yes it's that small. The stove is right behind the door, so if you're cooking and someone enters, bang.

University View,https://www.yelp.com/biz/university-view-college-park,1.0,"I will honestly say that the primary reason why I am rating this complex so low is the CHARGES.

I lived here for two years during my junior & senior year at UMD. I did appreciate the placement convenience to the university (as well the option of not having to live in an on-campus dorm). But for $920 a month (on average, including utilities), I must say that these charges were a complete rip off. There was nothing at all special about the apartments, just a solid white room which crappy furniture. Sure the gym was nice, but practically all the other amenities were crap.  
Overall, we paid over $20,000 to this place for my housing. Was it worth all the struggle and strife? Not at all. 
Looking back on it all, I would have even settled for living at the University Club (which is a notorious off-campus dump).

Be careful with your room-key, because if you lose it after-hours (which is 8pm), they will charge you a $75 fee.  

What's next? After I moved out for good, they charged me with ridiculous maintenance fees, saying that I need to pay for utility fees that I already paid in my monthly rent (even when I already had moved out!). Plus they charged me an extra $200 to replace the carpeting. For one, the carpeting was already shitty to begin with...but to make me responsible for it? That's beyond criminal!

The people that work at the View, including office staff and the security guards (not all the security guards though), were incredibly uncaring.
They just think of everyone as stupid college students, which makes dealing with them even worse.   

If you are an upperclassmen or a freshman trying to find off-campus housing, try the Varsity. At least the Varsity has NICELY furnished apartments for the same amount of money as the View.  
AVOID this over-priced s**thole, at all costs!!!

Lastly, I will honestly say that out of my entire experience in College Park, living at the University View was the worst because all of my bad memories were HERE.",2014-08-30,Avery L.
University View,https://www.yelp.com/biz/university-view-college-park,2.0,"For what I'm paying I want them to know what's wrong.

This is my mid year report to them.  I'm not trying to be funny 


I wish you would hire a cycle instructor.  I don't like that I don't have the option to unlock the front door.  I hear strange noises at night in my room.  I do not like the location of the bus stop and the 117 bus is ridiculous.  Especially with my night classes, no thank you I do not need a tour of College Park's night life on my way home every night.  I would also like if the retail spaces offered more than emptiness.  I would love a supermarket, Panera Bread, or arcade even.  The mail service is also a tad slow.  I order mail that I pay extra for it to come overnight and it is mailbox size.  I get it a week later at least.  This has happened all three time I've ordered mail.  I am also sad that a few people have access to the side door and I do not.  Also recycling is a big hassle.  I would also like an overhead light in my bedroom.  I miss brightness.  The window facing a giant building and bus stop is not the idea ""view"" I usually can't even tell how the weather is from my room.  I am also confused as to which direction our traffic circle goes.  It would have been truly innovative if you had build a recycling shoot next to the garbage shoot.  Also when I moved in the dishwasher was broken.  It took months, calling every single day to get someone on that.  Literally months.  A lot of the things you have you only have to tell people you have like the Ethernet connections [doesn't work for me, it works for my roommate's rooms but not mine, but after the dishwasher experience it just isn't worth the huge hassle.]  also the pool is only 3 feet deep.  Also the elevators are very crowded at certain times, but for some reason, which I do not know.  The stairs to my floor are locked.  My new years resolution was to take the stairs instead of the elevator, but that's impossible.   Please unlock the stairs.  Also the utilities are delivered to my mailbox after they are due, making it a little hard for me to pay them on time.  The light switch to the room with my sink in it is located in a very inconvenient spot.  Also the medicine cabinet's magnet to make it close falls off.  I also wish I could at least rotate the bed, but it doesn't fit between the walls.  I'm not strong enough to open the windows.  I am very far away from my very early class next semester.  We will see how that goes.  The vending machines are over prices.  Lower prices on chocolate would make me happy.  Our shower has problems draining and my roommate is unhappy that the door to the sinks blocks her bedroom.  The carpet gives me rug burn and I do not like that we have an electric stove.  The desk/dinning room chairs ""designed for students"" are silly and also a tad scary.  In addition to not being strong enough to open the windows, I am also not tall enough to get into my bed.  I have created a dangerous step system out of boxes to climb onto that thing.  Also, I am incapable of separating the dressers as advertised.  The dinning room is also in an unfortunate spot.  No one goes in there, but I do know for a fact that the living room furniture all fits in the dinning room, but all four mattresses do not fit well in the living room.  The way the toilette flushing button looks confuses my guests and sometimes they just give up and don't flush, then I don't like them anymore.",2011-01-11,Ellen G.
University View,https://www.yelp.com/biz/university-view-college-park,1.0,"One-sentence review: The pool they boast about is three feet deep. Expect everything else to be the same.

Now, for my longer review. University View was part of the reason I came to the University of Maryland. Once I was placed 800-something on the waiting list for on-campus housing (don't you love how they treat transfers?), I knew I needed to find a place. The View seemed perfect. Newly-built, it was the closest to campus I could possibly find.

My lust did not turn to love. Part of this review is due simply to the horrible nature of real estate dominated by college kids. But a management's handling of the situation is everything. And the tenancy will always help define your view of a place.

The tenants are awful. While acts of destruction seem to be a staple of apartment housing in College Park, the destructiveness here was ridiculous. The management's response was worse. Both ineffectual and largely intrusive, the management resorted to vague threats while also installing video cameras in the hallways; broken lights continued to adorn the hallway walls anyway.

The management also took to a bizarre policy of only letting people in -- including my parents -- by taking their ID. Half the time, when you came back down, the security guard disappeared and you had to hunt them down. While I appreciate security measures, I appreciate a trust from my management even more; trust goes both ways, folks. They even took the absurd step of locking the side entrance after 10 PM, the side upon which I either came from my parked car or on my bike. Great.

Many of the tenants also had some strange superiority to their attitudes. It was inhabited by kids with little self-respect, who seemed to think much was owed to them. One symbolic memory I have was watching a kid try -- and fail -- to get his Hummer inside the garage. No doubt he tried to sue the place.

The apartment itself was nothing special. Small and already furnished, I knew of little else to compare it to. Looking back, the prices were outrageous for what I got. And it turns out, if you're not in engineering, math, or physics, you're about as far as you could be from the majority of your classes.

All of this culminated in my final, horrendous day at the View. It was the beginning of August, 2006. I went down to the main office to figure out who my new roommate would be (my last one -- an awesome guy -- graduated in May). Instead, they informed that my room was now a girl's room. ""What!?"" Yes, I was supposed to have vacated my apartment the day before. They had no new lease from me.

Now, this was back in the days before I learned to take absolute control of the more important material aspects of my life. My dad, bless his heart, had simply not noticed the new lease in his mail, and it was never signed or returned.

Sadly, University View gave me, the tenant, no notice of this whatsoever. It did make sense to send the lease to the co-signer. And my dad was somewhat to blame for this mix-up, and I have since learned to follow up more. But there is no excuse for the way in which I was not notified -- not once -- that they had not received a new lease, and that I was to vacate the apartment.

This left me scrambling to move out in the course of less than 12 hours. While the staff downstairs was courteous, I found myself visited by the Regional Manager a few hours into my hurried rush of packing. The bitch (there's no better word for her actions) immediately yelled at me to vacate. Obviously uninformed and unwilling to risk becoming informed, she continued to yell until I finally ordered her out of my apartment.

A year of living there, summed up in a single day. I can easily say I'm glad I'm gone. What seemed like an honest attempt on the View's part to gentrify College Park has devolved into another crap apartment, but with a facade of attractiveness.",2008-03-30,Josh S.
University View,https://www.yelp.com/biz/university-view-college-park,1.0,"to sum up this review: I would give university view 0.5/5 stars. my reasoning follows:

do NOT live at University View. you will only experience anger, frustration, regret, and a very light wallet. they will try to bill you for anything possible whether it be utilities or ""damage"" to your room or even using the printer. 

if you don't have a garage parking spot ($85/mo) then your next best option is the school lot (lot 11) located behind the View. if you have to park in lot 11 you're forced to pay ""resident"" rates (due to an agreement with the View and UMD DOTS) even though you technically don't live on campus. on top of that you have to vacate your car from the lot 3 hrs prior to every home basketball game (about 15). you will likely park in another school lot, prob lot 1 located on the other side of campus, so then you have to move it back by 7 am. think about it, you have to drive your car from lot 11 to lot 1, park it, and walk back to the View or wherever you're going. then, sometime between when the basketball game ends and lot 11 clears up, probably 11pm, you have to walk back to your car to drive it back to lot 11. your time is better spent than walking back and forth across campus to move your car, especially during the frigid winter. I don't understand why we should pay for a parking spot we can't use. basically, if you live at the View and have a car you will either get a garage spot and be ripped off or get a lot 11 spot and move your car constantly.

since I do not have a garage spot (because it was full), when I buy groceries I have to use a cart to load my groceries to bring to my room. you have to sign out carts at the main entrance by the office, but you can only wheel them out through the side entrance. by the way, you can't park at the side entrance so essentially you have to park by the main entrance (if a spot is even available), rent the cart, wheel it through the garage and out the side door then back to the front where your car is, load your groceries, and wheel back again to the side entrance. if you try to go through the front entrance the guard will give you a hard time because the wheels will scratch the floor. all you wanna do is put the food in your fridge, but you have to push the damn cart back and forth before you can even get it in the building. 

utilities are ""included"" up to $25. it's a SCAM. you will inevitably use more than $25 worth of utilities and have to pay the overage which can be as high as $125. most importantly, utilities are determined as a building as a whole, not by individual apartments. so even if you are conservative and turn off the AC when you're gone, some careless person upstairs could leave it running all day and night and you will have to pay for that. 

you don't even get HD channels and the channels you do get are very basic. you have to pay to upgrade (of course). the Internet can be slow or not work at all sometimes. 

the rooms aren't even that big for how much you will pay.

management treats you like an idiot and often when I go down to the office to ask questions about leasing or subleasing or parking or maintenance or mail they are mostly clueless.

overall, I've found living at the view to be extremely aggravating. I could not wait to move out. I guess if you have lots of money you won't mind living at University View, but if you're like me and want to spend your money wisely, find ALTERNATIVE housing.",2011-08-26,Dewey T.
University View,https://www.yelp.com/biz/university-view-college-park,1.0,"I live in View 1. The View is outrageous. There's new competition next door coming: Enclave and Parkside, and the View still does not lower their rates (~$850/mo for the cheapest). On top of that, they say that you virtually won't be paying for utilities (there's a cap for the building and anything over will be divided between all units). Some months, each tenant must pay $4 each. However, other months, like this past November, they charged $125. That means, if they're saying utilities are included, your monthly rent can range from $850-$1,000. And there is nothing you can do to change this, because you're responsible for the ENTIRE BUILDING. I'm done with living at the View. The guards are nice, but the owners do not care about the tenants.
Tonight sent me over the edge. They charge $75 if you lose your key and want a new one after business hours. That's a little outrageous, but it's slightly reasonable considering they have to move someone from their home to do it for you (well that's what they SAY). However, my key suddenly stopped working (it's electronic). And they STILL want to charge me for a new key. Now I can't get into my room for a few hours unless I pony up $75, because my roommates are gone for superbowl parties.

Maintenance took about a month and half to service any of my requests without any notifications as to why. I was told my requests would be completed within a week when it became a month and half. This place is also obnoxiously loud with parties and drunkards roaming the streets. This sucks because the walls are super thin and I hear every single thing that happens outside, next door, across the way, in the hallway, upstairs, and etc... It's very frustrating. People also like to pee and poop outside windows, in the hallways, throw broken class everywhere, throw up in the hallways, the hallways always smell disgusting, and there are problems with roach infestations.

Venue at North Campus,https://www.yelp.com/biz/venue-at-north-campus-apartments-tampa-2,1.0,"Customer service is nonexistent at this complex. After moving out in December to transfer back home in Texas, the Venue staff was suppose to lock my personal door until I find someone to sublease my room. After finding out through social media that my door was unlocked and being used, I called the front office to speak to a manager. I had to call 4 times within that one day to talk to someone with access to my information. The manager told me that she would have someone lock it that day and give me a call back to let me know if there were any damages to my room. I never received a call back from her that day so I called the next day and I got told the same thing again. After not receiving a call back again, I called the next following day. Still nothing. It has been one week, no one is giving me any information about my room, and my calls/messages are not being returned. It is completely unethical to tell a person that their room is locked and find out a month later that my former roommates are utilizing my room without my and the leasing offices approval which causes a breach in my lease agreement.
